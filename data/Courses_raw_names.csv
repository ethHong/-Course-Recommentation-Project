NAZI GERMANY ,"This course is a survey of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. 

My hope is that through this class you will become better communicators, 
better critical thinkers, and better readers. Consistent class attendance and 
participation in oral and written discussion of the required texts will allow 
you to improve your oral and written communication skills. An 8-10 page primary 
source research paper will give you the chance to “do history” and begin 
asking historical questions of primary and secondary sources."
"GENERATING, READING AND CRAFTING POETRY WRITTEN FOR THE NOW ","There is no such thing as a wrong question, but there is such a thing as a bad 
poem. Bad poetry is usually poetry written in haste, sloppily, and with very 
little thought. Like the Edison diatribe, 1 percent inspiration, ninety-nine 
percent perspiration, great poetry and poets are measured by the weight of the 
labor they put behind their work.  Like the value of a suit or dress can be 
measured by the quality of materials and craftsmanship of the tailoring, poems 
can be measured by craft and content. There are equally great poems about 
wheelbarrows and poems about war. Great poetry can come from the smallest of 
things. Students in this class will learn how to identify good materials and 
craftsmanship. How to make poems from the smallness of things.
    A poem may travel on any number of vessels and takes many forms, but it is 
extremely rare for a poem to be finished in one sitting.  Poems usually find 
their form through a process of revision that takes the course of several 
months, years, decades or a lifetime. With that in mind, this class will be 
primarily dedicated to the process of revision. Students will be asked to write 
a small group of poems refined over the course of the semester. As poems are 
most often found grouped together in collections, books, or projects, we will 
also study how poems press up against each other and become unified by a common 
style and theme."
HEIDEGGER`S BEING AND TIME: AN INTRODUCTION TO CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY ,"In the course, we will study Heidegger`s Being and Time (Sein and Zeit), which 
is widely regarded as one of the great philosophical masterpieces of the 
twentieth-century, and is one of the foundational texts of the so-
called ""continental"" tradition of philosophy. In Being and Time, Heidegger 
challenges what he regards as the underlying presuppositions of the Western 
tradition of philosophy, and suggests a new way of thinking about the way in 
which human beings exist in the world."
PERIPHERY AND CENTRE: THE MAKING OF EARLY MODERN BRITISH AND IRISH HISTORY ,"In many ways the birth of the modern world can be traced back to the British 
islands, whose extraordinary historical impact has been so strikingly out of 
proportion to their size geographically. We shall examine the historical 
evolution of the British Isles in the Early Modern Era (c. 1500 – c. 1800).  
This was the key period in shaping both the British Isles themselves and their 
connections with the world at large. We shall pay special attention to the 
relationships between English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh peoples and 
governments. A central theme will be tracing the emergence and refashioning of 
identities in the diverse territories of the British Isles across this seminal 
historical period in the emergence of the British state and empire.
Students who complete this course successfully should be able to describe the 
major trends in the history of the British Isles, including the interaction 
between England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, the development of local and 
national institutions of government, the evolution of language and literature, 
and the course of relations between the different territories and populations 
of the British Isles and the broader world.
Students will develop their research, writing, and oral presentation skills 
over the semester.  They will become familiar with the primary sources most 
commonly used by historians of the early modern British Isles, learn to 
distinguish them from secondary sources, and develop their ability to analyze 
both types of sources in constructing persuasive historical arguments."
"PHOTOGRAPHY, WAR, AND HISTORY ","Since the mid-nineteenth century our understanding of war has been mediated 
through photographs. Despite the ubiquity of digital video and film, 
newspapers and blogs today prominently feature still photographs of 
contemporary wars, while wars of the past are often visually defined by the 
photographs reproduced in museums and textbooks. Photographic evidence has 
been used to gain support to go to war, to mobilize populations to continue 
war, to prosecute those who commit atrocities during war, and to memorialize 
the dead after war. In spite of the centrality of photography for modern 
understandings of war, photographic images are notoriously difficult to 
interpret.  This interdisciplinary seminar takes up that challenge. We will 
examine the relationship between war, history and photography by considering 
photographs from multiple angles: as creative works of individuals; as 
material objects that are processed, produced, distributed, and appropriated 
by users; as ambivalent representations of an “authentic” reproduction of 
the past; and as the source material for family histories and national 
narratives. After an introduction to several theoretical approaches, we will 
proceed chronologically through a history of modern warfare from the Crimea to 
Iraq.

As with all of my seminars, my hope is that through this class you will become 
better communicators, better critical thinkers, and better readers. Consistent 
class attendance and participation in oral and written discussion of the 
required texts will allow you to improve your oral and written communication 
skills. An 6-8 page primary source research paper will give you the chance to 
“do history” and begin asking historical questions of primary and secondary 
sources."
IMPERIAL CHINA: VIEWS OF HISTORY ,"This course examines the history of China from the classical period of warring 
states and philosophers to the end of the imperial system. Rather than high 
politics, we will focus on changes within society; some topics we will examine 
include the impact of social changes on “traditional” Chinese medicine, human 
impact on the natural environment, the different experiences of men and women, 
and the ambiguous and shifting nature of government control."
PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOANALYSIS: FREUD`S THEORY OF DREAMS ,"This course will explore the philosophical and scientific status of Freud`s 
theory of dreams."
POIESIS OF POETRY ,"The class will outline and survey poetic technique and form in poetry in the 
English language and tradition."
ANCIENT GREEK AND ROMAN NOVELS ,"In this class, we will read the texts that constitute an alternate tradition 
of ancient Greco-Roman novels and Menippean satire—Heliodorus’ Ethiopian 
Tale, Apuleius’ The Golden Ass, Petronius’ Satyrica, Seneca’s 
Apocolocyntosis, and Lucian’s Icaromenippus and Necymantia—so that everyone 
may better understand Western literary production and the history of the 
novel. 

But because ancient novels obsessively focus on and thematize the related acts 
of reading, writing, and interpretation, they turn out to be productive 
fillips for introducing contemporary literary theory. By working our way 
through an archive of chronological secondary readings in the history of 
Western literary theory, students will consider strategies for rethinking old 
texts, and practice more sophisticated approaches to textual analysis by 
engaging with semiotics, deconstruction, Marxism, psychoanalysis, post-
colonialism, queer theory, feminism, and critical race studies. 
(Acknowledgement: The theory portion of this course is indebted to Prof. 
Daniel L. Selden’s “Lit 101,” Spring 2005, UC Santa Cruz)."
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ,"This course is intended to study and understand 
1) How the financial institutions have been doing for investment analysis, 
2) why would they intend to provide various financial services (product mix), 
3) what happened to the world after 2008 global financial turmoil, and 
4) How to invest your valuable resouces for the future.
 
To understand the basic character and the purpose of the existing investment 
analysis done/published by many financial intermediaries (including investment 
banks, commercial banks, specified securities houses, asset management 
companies, credit card companies, insurance companies, pension funds, private 
equity funds, hedge funds and etc.)  As an undergraduate student, to understand 
a big picture on the development of global investment analysis and learn to be 
ready to produce your own analysis is very important no matter what he/she 
might want to do for life in their future.  Also, all students should be able 
to analyse any social and financial events in conjunction with the changes of 
the relevant industries including mobile, internet, high tech and general 
manufacturing industries."
CHANGES IN ASIAN INTERNATIONAL ORDER AND CHINA`S POLICY ,"The purpose of this seminar is to provide students with the theoretical and 
practical foundations for the analysis of China`s foreign and security policy.
In this course we will come to terms with the dramatic rise of China through 
reviewing major developments in contemporary Chinese foreign policy. The 
course will focus on recent developments in China’s evolving relationship 
with the rest of the international system, and attempt to identify and explain 
China’s emerging role within the contemporary international politics. It will 
also consider the nature of China’s rise on the world stage."
국제인권개념의역사와논점 ,"This course is intended to be an introduction to the idea of human rights.  
The objective will be to develop a critical understanding of the major 
issues surrounding human rights, as well as the intellectual roots 
of the modern-day concept of human right.  The focus will be more on 
the philosophical and historical aspects of human rights, rather than on the 
institutional features of international human rights law.  The justification 
for this approach is the conviction that a firm grasp of the historical and 
theoretical issues will provide a better foundation for understanding the 
contemporary legal issues and debates.  
	The course will be divided into two equal parts, which roughly 
correspond to the two components of the idea of “human rights.”  The first 
part—-dealing with the ""human"" part—-will examine the historical development 
of the concept of human rights.  The underlying theme will be: Who counts as a 
human being?  We will study some of the ancient, medieval, and early modern
intellectual traditions that contributed to the modern conception of human 
rights.  In the second part—-dealing with the ""rights"" part-—we will cover 
some of the current theoretical controversies surrounding human rights, which 
will be useful for understanding the modern practice of human rights. Here, 
the underlying theme will be: What does it mean to have a right?"
NGOS AND DEVELOPMENT ,"I.	Course Objectives and Scope
The global community is witnessing the growing impact of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and international non-governmental organizations (INOs) 
in local, national, regional, and international spheres. This course will 
discuss issues related to the disciplines of economics, political science, 
sociology, development studies, international relations, and others. It will 
also explore a variety of theories on NGOs, the nature and extent of civic 
participation and NGO participation, and the role of NGOs and NPOs in the 
policy-making process. The course is appropriate for students interested in 
NGOs from a research or policy perspective as well as those students who may 
work with or in these NGOs or INGOs in future career. 

In order to achieve the aforementioned objective, you need to think 
critically, rigorously, and theoretically; locate and synthesize needed 
information from a wide range of books, professional journals, and online 
sources. At the end of this course, you should be better able to communicate 
orally and write appropriate reports and term papers for an academic 
community, a policy community, and also for the general public. Please work 
effectively as a contributing member of class and exercise leadership skills 
for any given tasks you may have during the semester."
생물전달현상 ,"Transport of momentum, energy and mass is essential for living organisms to 
sustain their lives. Investigating how the living organisms accomplish 
sophisticated ways of biological transport requires good understanding of 
transport phenomena including fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and mass 
transfer. Moreover, concepts and principles to be delivered in the course are 
prerequisites for bioengineers to design and operate downstream bioprocesses. 
This course is intended to provide students with fundamental principles in 
transport phenomena and relevant topics in biological systems."
생화학(2) ,"How do cells produce and process the biomolecules that are essential for their 
function?  Networks of chemical reactions are employed by all living things to 
convert substances obtained from the environment into the biomolecules needed 
for growth, reproduction, and normal cellular function.  Topics covered in 
this course include the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and 
nucleotides.  Each of these metabolic pathways requires the coordination and 
regulation of multiple enzymatic steps.  The importance of these pathways can 
be appreciated when one considers the processes that depend upon them.  These 
processes include, but are not limited to, the transmission of genetic 
material, cell division, energy production, and the biogenesis and maintenance 
of cellular membranes."
PUBLIC POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION ,"This course is designed to provide the student with basic knowledge of public 
policy and administration by focusing on policy issues in Korea in the United 
States. First, we will begin by dealing with some theoretical approaches that 
can help us understand policymaking process. Second, we will examine political 
institutions and procedures through which individuals or interest groups seek 
to achieve policy goals. Third, we will cover specific policy issues such as 
education, health care and social security. I hope that by the end of course 
students will be able to analyze policy issues as well as to develop policy 
expertise in various areas."
NORTH KOREAN FOREIGN POLICY ,"The Kim Jong-un regime in North Korea triggered world wide concerns not only 
for South Korea but also surrounding countries of the Korean peninsula. It is 
a transcient period of a country that possesses nuclear weapons.  North Korea 
has successfully confronted the United States for more than twenty years and 
it conducted nuclear tests in spite of repeated warnings from the George W. 
Bush administration and China. And now, they seemed to be successful to 
realize unprecedented three-generation succession from Kim Il Sung to Kim Jong-
il and then to Kim Jong-un. This course is designed to illuminate what is the 
source of North Korea`s provocative diplomacy vis-a-vis the United States, 
what are their logics and how to solve the nuclear issue."
HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION ,"The aim of this course is to acquaint you with the relationship between human 
rights and conflict resolution in international relations, through a focus on 
both theoretical considerations and comparative empirical examples from a range 
of geographic contexts. At the core of the course is the presentation of key 
concepts relevant to understanding and analyzing critically the politics of 
norms, human rights, justice, conflict and peace. 
The first half of the course covers these concepts in relation to different 
types of conflict and methods of conflict resolution, drawing on relevant 
theory and scholarly debate to encourage you to develop an awareness of the 
diversity of opinion in the field and the options available in thinking about 
peace-building. The emphasis in this section is on describing and challenging 
you to think about the tension which often arises between defining, 
institutionalizing and defending human rights, and processes of conflict 
resolution – often summed up as an incompatibility between justice and peace in 
the execution of transitional justice to address the legacies of human rights 
abuses. 
The second part of the course takes a comparative perspective, exploring the 
course themes in more detail in a range of empirical contexts, including South 
Africa, Rwanda, Timor Leste, the former Yugoslavia as well as the Korean 
peninsula."
주니어세미나(SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY AND SOCIAL CHALLENGE) ,"This course will expose the students to the rapid change in science and let 
them ponder its impact on society.  Also the output of this seminar could be 
published as a part of a book which is planned by the faculty on the topic."
WORLD LITERATURE: RENAISSANCE LITERATURE ,"“Shakespeare, Media, Appropriation” begins with the concept that, as Marshall 
McLuhan wrote, ""The medium is the message.” In other words, “Shakespeare” 
and “Shakespeare’s plays” are not only experienced differently in varied 
media, they really ARE different. So, the argument goes, it is only common 
sense to experience and examine the plays within the context of their 
representational media – film, TV, social media, and even the “old-fashioned” 
printed book. Thus, in this class we will consider the plays through the ways 
in which media affect their shape and our experience of them. A further 
emphasis will be the ways in which the dissemination of Shakespeare globally 
and the reverse circulation of international high and popular culture back to 
Anglo/American arts by way of Shakespeare is changing literature as a concept 
and practice.

Course Goals

•To understand relations among the concepts of text, performance, medium, 
remediation, and appropriation;
•To understand and analyze Shakespearean plays or poems as texts;
•To understand and analyze Shakespearean plays or poems as performances;
•To understand and analyze Shakespearean plays or poems as mediated 
experiences;
•To analyze selected Shakespearean plays in terms of the effect played by 
changes in media on viewers’, auditors’, and audiences’ experience and 
understanding of the plays;
•To demonstrate the effects of media and remediation on Shakespearean plays;
•To understand Shakespeare`s changing literary, cultural, and educational 
contexts."
"THE ETHNOGRAPHIC EYE: READING KOREAN FASHION, CULTURE, AND SOCIETY ","This Spring edition of the course will combine theoretical, methodological, 
and practical/experimental content to offer a dynamic take on contemporary 
qualitative research, especially performative, autoreferential and creative 
ethnography. Our main topic is “Songdo,” or better: our lives 
in/around/about it. The professor will be very lenient regarding required 
theoretical readings but will insist upon rich class discussions of visual, 
music and verbal examples and on two individual micro-projects (one midterm 
project and the final project).
Students and the professor will study, describe, and debate spaces, places, 
times and rhythms of the island district of Songdo: lurking, gazing, spying, 
asking, experimenting, and performing."
CONTEMPORARY WOMEN’S CINEMA ,"This introductory film course examines the work of contemporary women 
directors in the context of global cinema culture. We will study films by 
female filmmakers from North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, 
Africa and Asia, with an emphasis on challenging, aesthetically innovative 
work. Questions of female authorship and spectatorship, feminist film critique 
and critical approaches to genre, among other key theoretical debates, will be 
covered in this course.
Through screenings and course readings, students will be exposed to key 
concepts and ideas central to feminist cinema including sociological, 
semiotic, ideological and psychoanalytic approaches. We study how women are 
particularly represented by female directors, and how women function as 
spectators in a sphere that accommodates alternative visions of women’s 
social roles and subjectivities. We will discuss the works’ thematic 
commonalities and differences, and the varying national, historical and 
industrial contexts from which these contemporary films emerge.
Through film analysis, research and study, participants will understand 
various cinematic techniques and concepts such as montage, mise-en-scène, 
address and point of view; and be familiarized with formal aspects of cinema 
such as camera, lighting, editing, sound, music, performance, production 
design, etc. Students will gain tools of textual analysis through examining 
the film’s overall structure, sequences, scenes and shot-by-shot analysis.
The syllabus is subject to change. Please consult the instructor with any 
questions."
STORYTELLING AND VISUALIZATION FOR DESIGNERS ,"Storytelling is one of the most timeless and effective ways to delivering 
ideas. It is useful not only to deliver information but also to persuade one`s 
opinion. Hence, Storytelling and structuring concepts are important for 
designers. Sufficient idea and logic should support visual outcomes. Finally, 
design works become most influential and amusing when they can both visually 
and conceptually interest audience. The overarching themes of the course are 
deliberately broad to allow scope for individual interpretation and analysis 
that comes from thorough study of a subject."
대중문화론 ,"대중문화의 양상에 대한 이론을 공부하고 이에 대해 논의하는 것이 본 과목의 목적이
다. 넓은 의미로는 인간의 삶 자체가 하나의 ‘문화’이고, 따라서 ‘대중문화론’이
란 우리의 살아가는 방식을 연구하는 것이기도 하다.

한편, 6주차부터 5~6회에 걸쳐 매주 수요일에는 시의성 있는 대중문화 쟁점을 하나씩 선택
하여 자유롭게 토론하는 시간을 가질 예정이다. 따라서 수강생은 최근의 중요한 문화적 쟁
점들에 대해 충분한 정보를 습득하여 토론에 참여할 의무가 있다.

(수요토론과는 별개로, 학생들은 조 편성을 해서 청년문화, 스포츠/게임, 섹슈얼리티, 텔
레비전/영화 중 한 가지 주제를 선정하여 해당 강의 주간에 연구결과를 발표해야 한다)"

SPECIAL TOPICS IN ASIAN STUDIES ,"This course is mandatory for all first-year students majoring in Asian 
Studies. 
Non-Asian Studies majors may take this course as a UIC elective course."
"AS LHP: ETHNICITY AND NATIONALISM IN SOUTH ASIA, 1830-1980 ","In this course, open to all UIC students, we will explore key concepts and 
readings concerning ethnicity and nationalism in South Asia. No background in 
South Asian history is necessary. The broadly chronological structure will 
begin around the time of Lord Macaulay’s famous Minute on Education, which 
helped to define the relationship between Asian identity and Western 
civilization, through the colonial, nationalist and post-independence eras, up 
to the revival of Hindu nationalism in modern India. Lectures will present 
historical and thematic outlines while readings, class work and discussions 
will focus on conceptualizing issues of race, class, caste, and gender within 
the complex nationalist politics of the Indian subcontinent. Important 
theoretical perspectives we will consider include those of the Cambridge 
School, the Subaltern Studies movement, and the work of scholars in disciplines 
including anthropology, psychology, postcolonial studies, and art history. 
Assessment will be in the form of three in-class assignments, three 3-4 page 
written essays, and weekly reading questions and responses."
MODERN CHINESE ECONOMY ,Comprehension of Chinese economy mainly from the perspective of entrepreneurs.
AS LHP: RACE AND VIOLENCE IN MODERN JAPAN ,"In this course, we will explore concepts and conflicts pertaining to racial 
and ethnic minorities in modern Japanese history. Today, we constantly witness 
acts of racist and ethnic violence perpetrated by both state and non-state 
actors elsewhere in the world. We also encounter a wide range of narratives 
implicating racist ideologies and their counterarguments through mass and 
social media. To better understand the historical context of such recent 
phenomena, this class examines theories and mechanisms of racism and violence 
and studies the ways in which they have worked in modern Japan as a case 
study. Topics include: theories of racism and violence, conflicts against the 
Burakumin, assimilation of the Ainu, violence against colonial subjects, 
racism and WWII, history of violence in Okinawa, and hostility against ethnic 
minorities including resident Koreans and migrant workers. The course also 
examines representations of racism and violence in works of fiction and film. 
Though the general focus will be on concepts and events relevant to modern 
Japanese history, the course also aims to help students understand the nature 
of racism and prejudice against minorities in other historical and social 
contexts."
중국경영론 ,"The course contents change annually. This year we focus on the advertising 
strategy in China."
ART AND THE CITY ,"This class pursues a new concept of study to integrate the creative arts and 
academic research across the course. It will seek to develop cross-
disciplinary studies and new research for artistic expression by creating 
individual or collective art projects. The target of project is ‘Songdo’ 
city, students’ residence and college neighbor, which has been developed by 
government plan. The goal of the class is ‘studying by art’.  The artistic 
research to ‘Songdo’ city in this class will be up-to-dated modes of study, 
exploration, knowledge, and discovery."
SEMINAR IN CHINESE BUSINESS ,"Seminar in Chinese Busines introduces both theoretical and practical 
knowledge in how Chinese business operate in domestic and global markets."
CONSULTING AND TECHNOLOGY ,
MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND POLICY ,"This course will develop a framework to help you understand and critically 
analyze media/entertainment players, media/entertainment users and culture, 
media policies and social impact of media/entertainment services"
KOREAN CULTURE AND AESTHETICS ,"This course introduces overview of Korean culture and aesthetics from 
perspectives of cultural creators."
MUSICAL STYLE AND COMPOSITION ,"This course is designed to teach compositional idas and techniques based on 
studying musical exmaples from various styles, including Classical,Jazz, 
Blues, Folk and Pop music. Students will be introduced to musical theory and 
structures by studying and analyzing representative examples from different 
musical genres. Regular musical writing assignments will include musical 
compositions and analysis."
TOPICS IN RELIGIOUS STUDIES ,"The 2nd Semester 2015 course will focus on the topic, “Religion & Politics in the
the West.” What is “secularization” and does this concept accurately describe 
the development of religion in the West?  Should religion be a part of a good 
city or good society and with what--if any---limits? What have Judaism, Christian
Christianity, and Islam taught about the proper relationship between religion 
and politics?  Is democracy compatible with the three Abrahamic religions? 
How might past thinkers illuminate issues being faced in a post-modern and 
post 9/11 world?
As a seminar-style course, class time will focus on discussing the
readings and making connections to current events and challenges. Preparation 
for class is essential. The professor will supplement with short 
lectures/introductions to the readings. Students will become familiar with 
concepts and with core writings that have shaped current thinking at the 
intersection of religion and politics. Through short response papers, students 
will also sharpen skills in critical reading, analytical writing, and applying 
theories in cultural and historical contexts. Each student will lead the seminar at 
least once and will complete a final project that includes a class presentation 
and paper."
ETHNOGRAPHIC APPROACHES ,"This is a course in both the Archaeology and Geology of Storytelling; our task 
is to un-earth and inscribe the stories of those whose stories would otherwise 
remain oral or go untold. Achieving it will require a series of approaches and 
entrances into subcultures through interview and participant observation. This 
will involve intensive listening, performance, and transcription."
PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOANALYSIS: FREUD'S THEORY OF DREAMS ,"This course will explore the philosophical and scientific status of Freud`s 
theory of dreams"
PERSPECTIVES ON LAW IN SOCIETY ,"The targets of the course are undergraduate students who do not major in law. 
The course is designed to broaden those students’perspective towards law so 
that the students can understand law’s functioning in various social 
contexts, to encourage students to develop their ideas about controversial 
issues in law and society, and to improve the ability to express those ideas.

The course begins with an overview of two traditions in legal thinking - 
natural law and legal positivisim -, followd by an overview of two tranditions 
in social science - the Durkheimian and the Weberian. It proceeds to discuss 
the social-scientific definition of law, the two sides of law – system and 
process –, law in the context of power and domination, economic implications 
of law, disputes and dispute resolution, the rule of law and social capital, 
the organization and function of the legal profession, the judicial 
organization and its functions, and the globalization of law.

The course will be conducted in a seminar format with active participation by 
students."
STUDIES IN CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION ,"The purpose of this class is to acquaint students with intersectionality—that 
is, the intersections of distinct yet interrelated systems of oppression, such 
as religion, ethnicity, race, class, sexual identity, gender, gender 
expression, and ability—in ancient Greece and Rome, as they are operative in 
primary texts by Sappho, Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Plato, 
Petronius, Martial, Catullus, Suetonius, and Apuleius, among others. We will 
employ a textbook, Marily Skinner’s Sexuality in Greek and Roman Culture (2nd 
edition, 2013)."
IMAGINATIVE WRITING ,"This course involves inscriptive expression in a variety of forms including 
poetry and prose. Those who wish to write imaginatively in any form are 
welcome. We will experiment with the poem and short story through exercises 
and imitation. The only prerequisites for this course are the desire to write, 
read, share your work, and comment good-naturedly on that of others. In 
addition to the required texts listed below, I will prescribe readings for 
each of you on the basis of your direction and progress throughout the course."
THE LITERATURE AND CULTURE OF NATURE ,"We will explore how to express the significances of Nature in our lives and the 
preservation of a natural environment through the medium of quality 
writings, East and West, including philosophy, poetry, essays and short 
stories, supplemented by masterful nature music, paintings and short video 
clips."
산업과전략 ,"Based on industrial organization theories, this course provides in-depth 
analyses of strategic behaviors of firms in imperfectly competitive markets. 
Topics include various pricing and product selection strategies; and strategic 
issues arising in markets with search costs, switching costs and network 
effects."

대사공학 ,"This course is designed to provide students with fundamental principles on 
engineering metaboic circuits for manufacturing of biomedicines, biochemicals, 
bioenergy and platform/commodity chemicals. Topics include kinetic and 
thermodynamic analysis of cellular processes (including enzymes and metabolic 
networks), genetic regulation, metabolic pathway and network analysis and 
analysis of synthetic genetic circuits."
ANCIENT & MEDIEVAL WESTERN POLITICAL THOUGHT ,"This is an introductory study of the development of ancient and medieval 
political thoughts from the time of the Greeks to the medieval, anticipating 
the rise of modern states. It is designed to analyze and discuss major 
political ideas and thoughts in the ancient and medieval times. Specifically, 
in this semester, we discuss political thoughts of four major thinkers, Plato, 
Aristotle, Augustine, and Acquinas, by reading some selected parts of their 
writings in English with major commentaries. This course is aimed to help 
students first understand major ideas and thoughts of the great thinkers of 
the times, and then to analyze their implications to the debates in 
contemporary political thoughts and philosophy as well as to contemporary 
liberal democracy."
INTRODUCTION TO POLITICAL ECONOMY ,"This course is designed to a basic understanding of group decision-making 
processes and political institutions along with “positive political 
economy,” which is grounded in rational choice assumptions and applies 
economic theory to a wide range of political phenomena (e.g. voter turnout, 
collective action problem, and regulatory capture). 
The course is divided into four sessions. The first session will introduce 
basic economic concepts. The second session will focus on social choice theory 
to understand individual choice and group decision-making processes. The third 
session will deal with collective action problems that indicate the market 
failure where individual rationality not to efficient provisions of public 
goods.  The final session will cover the role of political institutions in 
shaping policy outcomes.  
I hope that by the end of this course students will be able to analyze 
political decisions and policy –making processes with the knowledge learned in 
the classroom."
도시정치 ,"This course provides an introduction to ‘urban politics in a sustainable 
perspective’, and explains why sustainability is a growing concern for cities 
and city-dwellers. How do we define and achieve sustainable cities? How can we 
make Seoul or your city as a sustainable city? How do you analyze your 
community and enhance sustainability? We discuss problems of sustainability 
planning, energy supply and demand, water management, infrastructure and 
buildings and campus sustainability. We examine some real-world case studies 
from cities and towns in Asia and elsewhere to illustrate both problems and 
solutions. The course includes exercises to imagine and plan what would be 
required for the transition to more sustainable urban lifestyles, and to 
support the sustainability of cities in the 21st Century. This is a Community-
based Learning (CBL) certified class."
ELECTION CAMPAIGNING IN KOREA ,"This course is designed to explore elections and campaigns in Korea. Students 
will learn how voters evaluate candidates and parties to make their voting 
decision. The course consists of three broad subjects: electoral systems, 
voting behavior of electorates and political campaign. The main purpose of 
this course is let students understand more broadly 1) how and why the 
electorates votes the way they do, and 2) how candidates and campaigns can 
influence the electorates. Building upon a background in classic election 
studies and general understanding of voting behavior of Korean electorates, 
two election campaigns will be empirically examined: 2002 presidential 
election and 2012 National Assembly election."
ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND PUBLIC POLICY ,"Why some policies still continue even in the face of strong resentment on the 
part of the country people? Why state organizations do not do what they say 
they are doing? Why firms are so vulnerable to future uncertainties and 
indeterminacy? Why organizations cannot have minds of their own? 
According to the prevailing explanations of individual decision or public 
policy,individual, group, and organization`s identity and preferences are 
exogenously given and stable, and thus these rational choice theories 
typically analyze choice among available alternatives, even though the 
definition of the alternative itself is the exercise of power.
Without accounting for preference-making, explanations of when activities will
be made through value-maximizing market, state authorities, or international 
system are doomed to fail.
However, until recently public policy scholars didn`t pay very much attention 
to the unequal power relations in the organizational field, which is essential 
to the understanding of the complexity and dynamics of the policy-making 
processes. 
In this light,this course is a teaching tool about the origins, processes and 
the consequences of policy and its making in terms of organizational behavior. 
In the meanwhile we will come up with several appropriate answers as to when 
and why certain policy arise?; what are the social origins of the 
policy?; What role cultural politics plays in the process?; How 
persistent are the existing rules and culture?; What causes change in the 
nations’policy? ; What are the consequences of the 
institutional change?; and what should be a pertinent institutional structure 
for social corporatism?"
POLITICS OF PUNISHMENT ,"Through a close study of literary, theoretical, and polit
ical works from the Book of Job to 
texts by Simone Weil, Michel Foucault, Franz Fanon, a
nd Judith Butler, this class 
explores the role of punishment and violence in modern pol
itics. Politics, in this study, is 
fundamentally about the imposition of violence on indiv
iduals to create modern, political 
subjects and reframing violence from a generalized condition
 of nature to a social and 
political 
tool
.  Three  important  questions  will  guide  our  discussion  througho
ut  the 
semester: (1) What does violence 
do 
to individuals? (2) What are the moral implications 
of conceiving of punishment and violence as a human, as oppo
sed to divine, project? (3) 
What might moral and political responsibility look like i
n a world in which human beings 
simultaneously the wielders and victims of violence, as 
well as the judges of what 
constitutes legitimate (and illegitimate) violence?"
THE CONCEPT OF LAW: AN INTRODUCTION ,"This course is an introduction to the concept of law and is designed to help 
students new to the study of law master its most basic principles and 
concepts.  In this course, students will explore the primary sources of law 
and the processes by which laws are created, interpreted and applied. They 
will examine competing theories regarding the content, legitimacy, and 
authority of various types of law and consider the responsibilities and powers 
of different participants within the law making process. Students will also 
explore the scope and limitations of law as a method for securing and 
maintaining conditions of justice within a society.  Lastly, students will 
explore the practical aspects of law by participating in a mock corporate 
negotiation and a mock litigation."
INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ,
CHEMICAL SYSTEM CALCULATION ,
SCRIPT TO SCREEN ,"This course offers an introduction to the art of film and scriptwriting by 
exposing students to elements of dramatic writing and the filmmaking process. 
The course will cover principles of screenwriting including story structure, 
characterization and dramatic value. We explore film as an expressive creative 
medium, including production and post-production components such as camera and 
lighting, editing, acting and performance, sound and music, and production 
design.
Students undergo a fairly intensive hands-on experience with writing and 
making video shorts, and are encouraged to explore their creativity on the 
page, focus on visualization of stories and ideas to the screen, and develop 
unique voices in a cinematic format. Class participants will gain an 
understanding of visually effective storytelling through the study of 
filmmaking techniques, narrative strategies, and cinematic concepts such as 
montage, mise-en-scène and point of view. Students will develop their own 
tools for self-expression and storytelling, refine their viewing and 
interpretive skills, and enhance their aesthetic ambitions in film, writing 
and other creatively-driven media.
Classes will consist of lectures, screenings and discussion, and incorporate a 
workshop-oriented approach to writing, directing, editing, presentation and 
critique of works. Students are expected to write and develop their own 
material; exchange feedback; rewrite and prepare their scripts for shooting; 
direct and edit their own projects, both solo and as a group; and show their 
work for classroom discussion.  Class attendance and promptness are mandatory.
The goal of the course is not to attain technically polished results but to 
provide a means for self-expression and experimentation, and to gain insight 
on a media-based creative practice for further pursuits in related fields.
The syllabus is subject to change. Please consult the instructor with any 
questions"
CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY ,"This course offers an overview of the principal 20th and 21st century theories 
of space/place as they relate to cultural everydayness, supported by a range 
of case studies and examples that span across continents and cultures.  

The main objective of this course is to enable students to critically assess 
the spatial organization of contemporary culture, including spatial 
ramifications of power and identity, and to analyze the form and meaning of 
various spaces/places from ""representationalist"" (semiotic, discursive) 
and ""Non-representationalist"" (neovitalist, neomaterialist) perspectives."
IDEA VISUALIZATION ,"The purpose of this course is to help students develop their abilities for idea 
generation and design concept evolution through exercising their imagination 
and intuition in various ways.

During the first half of the course, students will be able to experience 
different ideational methods and visualization skills by doing a series of 
short design assignments. In the later half, students will be able to conduct a 
long-term group project in which they have opportunities to apply and integrate 
basic skills and methods that they learned from the first half."

"JAPANESE FICTION AND FILM: GENDER, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY ","This discussion-oriented course examines a variety of fictional works and 
films to complicate our conventional understandings of modern Japanese 
history. We specifically focus on inequalities pertaining to gender, class, 
and ethnicity manifest in cultural products but often overlooked in the 
dominant historical narratives. While closely examining novels, poems, films, 
manga, and anime, students are expected to learn diverse interpretations and 
imaginations of historical events and phenomena specific to modern Japan as 
well as methodological and theoretical tools to broadly ponder social problems 
through cultural products. The topics include: film experience as attractions; 
inequality behind Meiji modernization; gender and modernity in the Imperial 
capital; labor, colonialism, and Hansen’s disease in the prewar years; film, 
manga, and WWII; poverty, family, and ethnicity in the postwar years; and 
dissonance in the ""high growth era"" and beyond."

INTRODUCTION TO ART HISTORY ,"An introduction to visual and material culture and built environments from the Ancient Near East through 1650. We will trace developments in cultural and visual production at the center and periphery of the great empires of the pre-modern world with a focus on Asia, Europe, Africa, the Near East, and the Americas, with a consideration of political and religious institutions that regulated the production and use of images, objects, buildings and space. We will also focus on the impact of technological innovation and cultural exchange on art and architecture, including changes brought about by commercial expansion, cross-cultural contact, religious conversion, and pilgrimage."
FICTION WORKSHOP ,"This course will focus on the art and craft of writing fiction. Students will 
create original works of fiction that will be reviewed in small and large 
discussion groups. Literary topics of form, character, dialogue, plot, and 
other contemporary strategies will be at the forefront of our weekly meetings. 
Additional course texts will include novels and short-story collections from 
around the world. 

After the first few weeks of literary analysis, we`ll begin to workshop student 
fiction. Members of this class will submit and receive feedback on at least two 
stories. All classes will be highly interactive, and members will experiment 
with new writing styles and gain insight from a group of diverse and thoughtful 
readers."
MUSIC THEORY AND COMPOSITION ,"The course will be divided into three sections, designed to progressively 
introduce basic concepts of musical perception, theory and musical elements 
such as melody, rhythm, harmony, tone colors and musical structures through 
increasingly challenging compositional and listening 
exercises. In the first part of the course, students will focus on ear 
training and basic keyboard skill to develop discern pitch intervals and 
different rhythmic patterns with corresponding keyboard skill method. 
Secondly, students will become familiar with musical notation to integrate all 
these theoretic componants of musical composition. At this point students will 
be able to transcribe a simple composition of one voice melody in a proper 
meter with a basic rhythmic pattern.  Finally, we will study more advanced 
concepts of harmonies, tonality, modes that can be mold within musical forms, 
analyzing the underlying harmonic structures of compositions and learning 
conventional yet creative chord progressions and becoming acquainted with 
different tone colors (timbre), dynamics and articulation to  At this point 
students will begin to apply all that they have learned to create their own 
compositions. In the final weeks, students will work on a “final project” of 
their own composition, which they will have the opportunity to share with 
their fellow students."
TOPICS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE ,"This writing intensive seminar will explore the exciting new field of the 
cognitive science of religion. We will begin by asking what religion is and 
what features of religious beliefs and practices appear in all or nearly all 
cultures. Then we will examine several of the most prominent attempts by 
cognitive scientists to characterize and explain the nature of religious 
beliefs and practices. This will include proposed evolutionary explanations 
regarding possible adaptive advantages of religious beliefs in societies. We 
will also examine the development of religious beliefs in individuals, 
including its development in children. Inverting our perspective, we will also 
look at psychological theories of religious ¬disbelief, including the 
development of religious disbelief in children. Finally, we will examine 
neuroscientific evidence relating to religious experiences, including those 
enhanced by hallucinogenics and schizophrenia, as well as those that are 
diminished by Parkinson’s disease. Overall, our aim will be to assess the 
merit of cognitive science’s accounts of religious cognition and, 
specifically, to judge whether cognitive science supports, undermines, or is 
neutral with respect to a variety of religious perspectives. A background in 
cognitive science is not required for this course, only a willingness to 
examine a new field of inquiry and think about an active area of research 
where science and religion are interacting and are likely to continue to do so."
SPECIAL TOPICS IN POETRY ,
LAW AND BUSINESS IN KOREA ,"Course Description
This course will introduce the students to the general legal environment in 
which business people work and attempt to impart to the student a working 
knowledge of legal principles of some of the main areas business law: 
Contracts, Regulations of business and Sales. This course will also cover some 
issues in Torts and Principal/Agent relationship."
AMERICAN INDEPENDENT CINEMA ,"In this course, we will explore the world of American independent cinema with a 
focus on the 1980s-90s.  We will examine the early works of film school alumni like 
the Coen Brothers, Jim Jarmusch and Spike Lee. We will meet the members of the
“VCR generation"" including Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. We will also 
consider figures like Steven Soderbergh, who has alternated between blockbusters and 
small personal films; John Sayles, who has funded his socially conscious indie films 
by writing for the studios; and Todd Haynes, an experimental filmmaker who burst 
onto the scene with a film shot mainly with Barbie dolls. 

We will discuss their works with a view to understanding how they used their 
craft to express themselves in the face of daunting obstacles, often lacking 
funding, equipment, industry connections, or formal training, and in some cases 
overcoming geographical challenges and marginalized minority status. We will 
reflect on fractured narratives, auteur theory, and self-conscious cinema while 
we examine each filmmaker`s style and recurring themes. We will also view 
their works in a broader context as we consider the role of business interests 
represented by Miramax and the studios, institutions like the Sundance 
Institute, technological advances like the advent of video, the rise of multiculturalism, 
and the ever-present force of globalization. 

As we explore the world of American independent cinema at a seminal moment
in its history, we will grapple with many larger questions: What is an independent film? 
What are these films saying about contemporary life in the U.S.? Can we apply this 
case study to Korea or elsewhere, in film or any other field? And, for those with 
creative aspirations, what possibilities for personal expression exist for the creative artist 
in an age of digital reproduction, media conglomeratization, and shifting economic 
realities?"
"SCIENCE, MEDICINE, AND SOCIETY ",
SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION ,"In Asia and elsewhere, countries are facing major demographic and economic crises due to low birth rates and aging populations, engaging in a global war for talent. Using a comparative and sociological lens, this seminar explores how higher education can address such challenges and also help to achieve various socioeconomic goals, including international development and fostering innovation in Asia. We will examine various aspects of higher education with a particular focus on the broad themes of internationalization, diversity/ inclusion and talent/brain flows. The comparative cases will consist of the United States, China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Australia."
SOCIAL CHANGE IN MODERN KOREA ,"This course is an introductory survey of the development of Korean society 
throughout the modern era. The class begins with an examination of the social 
structure at the end of the Chosōn dynasty (1392-1910) and the transformation 
of Korean society through the colonial period (1910-1945), post-Liberation 
division and war (1945-1953), and contemporary society to the present. We will 
examine the history and processes of social transformation, focusing on the 
unique historical, political, social, and economic situation of Korea, but 
within a larger East Asian and global context. Specifically, students will 
examine the evolution of Korean society through internally and externally 
imposed changes as the rise of the modern nation-state converged with the 
penetration of foreign political influence and the global world economy."
OUR LIFE AS A JOURNEY-TRAVEL WRITING ,"""A good travel book is a treasury of wisdom that seeps into your blood as you 
follow the author on their quest."" -Tahir Shah. From our births we have been a 
driver of our body on a journey through life until death and maybe after. Each 
day is a journey from waking until sleep and onward into dreamland. We daydream 
and journey in our imagination. Then we travel by foot or by vehicle. But we 
don’t really know where we are coming from, where we are, and where we are 
going. In this course we will start in America and travel around the globe in 
the company of writers who pose all sorts of philosophical, social, political, 
religious, scientific and other questions of the societies they pass through. 
Ever since humans could read and write, the travel journal has been an 
educational, pleasurable and artistic genre. Great writers, who were also 
explorers and travelers, kept journals of their observations and adventures in 
their own and in foreign lands and cultures. They recorded their experiences in 
quality language and often draw pictures to share for the education of readers 
back home as well as for posterity. We will explore samples of travel writing, 
around the world, from the ancient times to the present-day, drawing on the 
works of diverse authors whose descriptions and thoughts can broaden our 
perspectives of “Life’s Journey” and sharpen our writing skills.You will be 
required to read the readings and be prepared to speak about them in class. The 
more your voluntarily offer contributions to the class the better. This will be 
a student centered class and everyone will be expected to be ready to reply to 
the professor`s questions during each class. You will be expected to keep a My 
Life`s Journey Journal, upon which along with class participation and 
attendance your final grade will be based."
POIESIS OF POETRY II ,"Since this class is a continuation of Poiesis I ?a course in formal poetry and poetics- we will be examining more modern poetry and approaches to writing that are less easily definable than sonnet, amphibrach or catalexis. I expect everyone to have a/an (relatively) active working agenda when it comes to writing -even if it’s not specifically in poetry- because we will start workshops early in week 2 and these will continue through the end of the semester. The final number of students in the course will determine the workshop schedule, so once this schedule is set I cannot alter it unless there are substantial abiding reasons."
UNDERSTANDING A VISUAL LANGUAGE IN FILM AND OTHER MEDIA ,"On completion of this course, students will understand basic film terminology and visual language and will be able to critically analyze the meaning of a visual sequence; students will understand film and other media as a whole, based on its basic components and cultural background. In addition, 
through comparing visual languages in various media, students will be able to examine and explore different production approaches. From this 
analysis, students will have opportunities to develop their own visual language as effective communicators. Finally, this course will provide students 
with the ability to break down sequences in films and other media and analyze them in a manner that extends beyond pure entertainment.

1.	To develop critical and analytical skills in viewing and evaluating films and other media.
2.	To examine and understand how visual works stimulate our emotions, influence our thoughts, and even guide our actions and beliefs.
3.	To perceive and understand the visual works and articulate this perception and understanding.
4.	To better understand another culture and production methods through the study of international film and media and comparison of different media.
5.	To explore and experiment with narrative construction both in visual strategies and shot-to-shot relations.
6.	To become well versed in conventional and alternative techniques of storytelling through readings, discussion and screenings of significant 
films and other media."
EAST ASIAN CINEMA AND CULTURAL CROSSING ,"This course comparatively examines East Asia cinema in the framework of inter/ 
intra-cultural junctures. Through the analysis of stylistics, thematics, and 
socio-political, historical contexts of cinemas of South Korea, China, Hong 
Kong, Taiwan, and Japan as well as of Asian-American filmmaking the ways in 
which these cinemas have been cross-culturally produced and received will be 
discussed. Questioning the notions of national cinema and nation-bound 
culture, discussion will also address the issues of gender, ethnic, and 
national identity that are raised and contested in the cinemas. Visual and 
theoretical analytic practices offered in the course will enable the 
perception of East Asian cinema in shifting scenes of the global media."
EXPERIMENTS IN AUTOBIOGRAPHY ,"What do a saint, professor of Japanese literature, ballet dancer, founding 
father, drug-addicted jazz musician, fashion magazine editor, safe cracker, 
Russian playwright, B-movie bombshell and Native American Indian Chief have in 
common? They all in some way attempted to write their lives. 

In this course we will explore how such various people define themselves, 
reflect on and give meaning to their lives through written expression in order 
to do so ourselves. The composition of our own autobiographies will entail 
examinations of the genre and self across cultures, disciplines, and 
languages. In doing so we will practice the art of autobiography in a variety 
of modes and forms -- Euclidean and non-Euclidean, narrative and non-
narrative -- involving verse, prose and transcription."
TOLKIEN`S FANTASY LITERATURE ,"We will discuss the following themes involving Tolkien`s life, works, and 
thought, and examine how Tolkien`s novels are relevant in our time.

*Tolkien`s World and Tolkien`s Thought: Premodern Background and Postmodern 
Mind

*Comparison between the novels and film versions

*Children`s literature (The Hobbit)
-Freud, The Infantile Sexuality (oral, anal, genital stages)

*Understanding Tolkien`s Literature: plot, characters, theme
-the diversionary tactics in The Lord of the Rings: Great eye and Small hands
-the female characters, etc.

*The Economy of Gift (Nietzsche, Mauss, Bataille, Derrida, Cixous)
-The Economy of Losing (The Lord of the Rings)
-The Economy of Sharing (The Hobbit)
-Forgetting and Forgiving

*Law and Justice (Derrida, Deleuze)

*Slow, indifferent, and collective: Eco-criticism

*the nature of hobbits, dwarves, dragons, spiders, etc.
 
*stories and histories: the importance of storytelling in Tolkien (Walter 
Benjamin, ""The Storyteller"")

*Tolkien`s secondary world: a fantasy literature (Tolkien, ""On Fairy Tales"")

*Tolkien`s Cultural Industry"
영국사상 ,"Britain, from the 17th to the 19th century, had been the leading innovator and 
propagator of many things the world has come to adopt as vital components of 
the modern world: market economy, parliamentary democracy, the rule of law, 
journalism, the metropolis, public transportation, pollution, insurance, 
tourism, spectator sports, NGOs, and of course English language itself. In the 
evolution of these various departments of modern civilization, formulations 
and arguments in words by individual thinkers went hand in hand with the 
collective practices of implementations and management. In this course we will 
be exploring such arguments in conjunction with their historical context. Our 
method will be ""dramatic"" in two senses. First, we shall go straight to hear 
what the important thinkers themselves had to say about the key issues of the 
modern world. Second, you shall act out their roles in your presentations and 
papers. Many of these names you must have heard of, although some would sound 
less familiar. But that all of them in different ways have set the model for 
thinking about the modern world is what you will discover as you read them and 
as you impersonate them. At the end of this course, you would be prepared to 
carry on your own debate with or through them on various issues of society, 
economy, politics, and culture."

한국문학과역사 ,"This course is a survey of modern Korean history through close readings of selected major literary works. Rather than offering a mere narrative of the peninsula’s history, it focuses on particular episodes, events, influences, and historical ruptures that have shaped the way Korean writers have interpreted and understood their past.  We will look at the use of a form of writing (“the novel”) as a historical source. We will examine the development of the long story form and the formalistic aspects of narrative as well as its cultural impact.  Major themes include the country’s opening to the West, its colonial experience and subsequent fratricidal war, and the divergent post-colonial paths of the two separate Koreas. Throughout, we will address the tensions of Korean nationalism, authoritarianism, and industrialization in conjunction with the politics of gender and class. 

The course will consist of one lecture session per week (Friday) and one discussion session on (Wednesday). 

Students are welcome to read the novels either in Korean or English.

CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST ,"What makes the Middle East one of the most unstable and volatile regions in 
the world? The answer to this question lies in understanding the 
roots of a series of inter and intra political, ethnic, and religious conflicts 
that have cast a dark shadow over the region since the end of World War I and 
the demise of the Ottoman Empire. This course will examine some of the 
prominent disputes and conflicts in the region through the looking glass of 
history and international relations. Among others, we will explore the 
Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Arab disputes that have resulted, so far, in 
seven wars and numerous hostilities between the opposing sides, and the 
Arab-Persian/Sunni-Shiite struggle for dominance in the Arab/Persian Gulf, 
which contributed a great deal to the eruption of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-
1988). We will also account for the effect of religious and ethnic 
sectarianism on the inner stability of states such as Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. 
We shall conclude our discussion by examining the prospects of reaching long-
lasting settlements to the aforementioned disputes."

NORTH KOREAN MEDIA STUDIES ,"North Korea remains one of the most isolated, least understood countries in the world due to the tight restrictions on access and on the flow of information imposed by the leadership in Pyongyang. Seoul, too, restricts access to information about North Korea with its stringent National Security Law. That lack of access to information on North Korea is particularly detrimental to South Koreans, whose peace and prosperity are intrinsically linked to overall security on the Korean Peninsula. How then do journalists, diplomats, aid workers and activists obtain the information that they base their North Korean programs and policies on? And how reliable is the information they are using?

This course explores the complications and challenges of obtaining accurate information about North Korea. We will get an inside look at North Korea’s propaganda machinery, examine the obstacles foreign journalists face in covering North Korea, and consider the complicated nature of relying on defectors for information. We also will explore how South Korean national interests and security concerns affect the quality of information on North Korea.

In this class, students will become well acquainted with the basic tenets of press freedom and journalistic standards and ethics. They will question and 
critique current media coverage, and examine the creative and resourceful ways journalists and researchers obtain information. And most importantly, they will put those skills to use in storytelling and multimedia projects aimed at disseminating new, accurate and reliable information about North Korea and its people.

This course would be suitable not only for aspiring journalists but also students seeking to pursue careers in government, policy, non-governmental organizations, aid work, public relations, academics and business. The critical skills learned in this course could be applied to other countries where information may be scarce or 
unreliable."
ISLAM AND CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ,"COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course examines theories and practices of politics in the Middle East and 
North Africa. It first reviews three competing theories in comparative 
politics, such as idea-based, institution-oriented, and interest-driven 
approaches. The course then explores main thematic topics by covering the 
issue of democracy, capitalism, and globalization. The themes are 1) the Arab 
Spring and democratic transitions 2) state-building 3) market liberalization 
and oil 4) civil society and Islamic community 5) regional security, power 
configurations, and terrorism. After a survey of the issues, it looks at the 
region’s various empirical cases differentiating bunker states, bullies, 
monarchies, and limited democracies. In doing so, this course aims to acquaint 
students with the current debate over the critical issues in the field and to 
teach them how to analyze and compare the approaches, themes, and cases."
THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE KOREAN WELFARE STATE ,"The course’s main purpose is to give students a familiarity with the Korea 
Welfare State. Therefore, it will introduce students to the history, various 
aspects, and reform issues of the Korean welfare state. Since the welfare 
state is not mere an amalgam of social policies, this course will cover 
related issues such as state-led industrialization, democratization, 
neoliberal economic reform, enterprise unionism and dualistic labor market in 
Korea. 
Although it is not a theory-oriented course, this course will introduce 
students to major competing theoretical perspectives on the Korean welfare 
state in order to make students into informed, well-balanced consumers of 
Korean politics. Also, this course will provide students with the rich 
historical/socioeconomic background to the origin and structure of the Korean 
welfare state to flesh out theoretical abstract understanding of welfare 
politics and social issues in Korea. 
Along with lectures, students will have an opportunity to make a presentation 
of welfare politics, social welfare programs or current social issues in 
comparative perspective."
POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA ,"This course deals with politics in Southeast Asian countries including their international relations. The first half of this course will focus on politics and society of individual Southeast Asian countries.  The first half of this course is a foundation for the second half of the course.  In the latter half, the course is designed to survey Southeast Asia by themes - Regionness, Colonialism and Nationalism, Economic Growth and Crises, Democracy, ASEAN and regional cooperation, and ASEAN`s external relations."
"ORDER, DISORDER AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY ","There are diverse views regarding how to deal with today`s bleak global 
economic ecology. But there is general agreement that the current economic 
problems have  economic, social, political and cultural origins; and that the 
prevailing development paradigms run their potential.

This course is intended to introduce students to the theories and practices of 
various development models at certain historically specific time.
We will, first, consider both mainstream and critical approaches to the study 
of political economy of development and comparative economic history, paying 
particular attention to the basic assumptions and propositions of the each 
major approach. 

Then we will review empirically how scholarships of each tradition explain 
development policy, performances, and international order/disorder  by 
analyzing several ‘Great Transformations’: From discussions of 
‘underdevelopment’, to neo-liberalism and the Washington Consensus, and to, 
almost concomitantly and to varying degrees, recent critical explorations from 
post-colonial, postmodern and feminist perspectives, and finally social 
economy and creative economy, which have undoubtedly provided important 
challenges to conventional development chronology.

In so doing, this course assists students in developing critical thinking 
skills with insight into, and knowledge of,various developmental experiences,
including the current state of economy. 
It is the power of this course to appreciate and discuss development 
discourses and their assumptions from different points of view."
ETHICS ,"In this course, students will learn to think systematically about the issues and questions that characterize the study of ethics. What is a right or wrong action? How do I know that an action is right or wrong? How should I live? What is happiness, and does it contribute to a meaningful existence? Does a universal or non-subjective answer to any of these questions exist? Through close readings of works of classical and contemporary thinkers, students will learn how to think through these and other questions of ethical behavior and the good life. 

In the final weeks of the course, students will work together to develop final projects investigating what might be one of the most pressing and urgent ethical crises of our time?the European refugee crisis. While we will discuss and agree upon the topics of these projects together as a class, some of the issues that I envision students might investigate include: the scope and depth of the duty of states to accommodate refugees, the duties of individuals with respect to the crisis, the requirements of a meaningful human life, and the issue of distance and geography in thinking about obligations for global crises."
FOREIGN POLICY IN KOREA AND BEYOND ,"The course ‘South Korean Foreign Policy and Beyond’ serves as a bridge between the domestic and international environment with a focus on how South Korea deals with the 
outside world. The course provides students with a comprehensive introduction to South Korean foreign policy. 
It first explores the nature of foreign policy analysis, the differing theoretical approaches, and the analytical models to explain and predict decision-making processes, before turning to the processes, institutions, actors, and calculations that contribute to foreign policy decision-making in South Korea. It then turns to the key issues facing South Korea’s foreign policy decision-makers.
The course encourages students to think creatively regarding how foreign policy decision-making can be affected by change in both the domestic and international environment 
through the use of simulation and debate. Students can expect to: (1) gain a greater understanding of foreign policy; (2) be able to identify, analyze and anticipate the determinants of foreign policy; (3) develop a set of tools to analyze and understand foreign policy; and (4) obtain an understanding of historical and contemporary South Korean foreign policy."
ANCIENT POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY ,"This course is designed to introduce students to the concrete problems and questions of ancient political philosophy. Focusing on the original texts of ancient political thinkers (Plato, Xenophon, Aristotle, Cicero), the course will allow students to think about the critical implications of the ancient political thoughts by themselves. The original insights of the ancient philosophers powerfully shed light on the problematic nature of human beings and their political way of life. Throughout the course, therefore, we will keep questioning the persistent problems of human nature in light of their political thoughts, rather than simply seeking theoretical answers to resolve contemporary political issues. For ancient thinkers, it is crucial for a human being to grasp above all the possible ways of approaching the true ground of political knowledge; for this task, they try to think about what knowledge itself is, revealing that the political problems are inherent in the human striving for the truth of being. In this light, the course addresses how the ancient thinkers deal with the possibility and limit of philosophizing, and how their political thinking can be related to the actual issues of being in the polis."
DEMOCRACY AND CONSTITUTION-MAKING ,"It is commonly taken for granted that ""We the People"" are the ultimate fount of legal 
authority and political legitimacy in a democratic constitutional order. According to 
this credo, the people have such a sovereign power because they authored the constitution 
they live under. But who are those people, and what makes a constitution democratic? 
What does it mean to say that people`s authorship creates the ultimate authority in 
a given polity? Can a constitution be made in such a democratic way, and if so, in what 
sense and to what extent? This course seeks to answer these theoretical questions by 
revising democratic constitution-making experiences of postwar Japan and South Korea. 

The course consists of three parts. the first section will review various theoretical and 
conceptual perspectives on democratic constitution-making. Some of the salient themes 
for common discussion are: revolutions and constitutions, popular sovereignty and 
constituent power, constitutional identity, democratic boundary-setting, imposed 
constitutions and transitional justice. Using these concepts as our primary toolkit, 
we will proceed to explore histories and theories about the making of Japan`s ""Peace 
Constitution"" (1946) and Korea`s ""Founding Constitution"" (1948), respectively, in the 
second and third sections of his seminar. For Japan, our discussion will focus on, 
among others, Article 9 (""peace provision""), ""symbol emperor system,"" ""August Revolution 
theory,"" and equal protection of the law. For Korea, discussion topics will include the 
Economy Chapter, socioeconomic rights, lustration, legal continuity and nationality."
PORTFOLIO THEORY AND APPLICATION ,"The goal of this course is to expose students to the fundamental concepts of investment theory. This will include an introduction to portfolio theory and application, asset pricing and the analytical tools of portfolio management."
ECOLOGY AND LAW ,Understand basic concepts of ecology and law and their relationship
환경정책과지속가능성 ,"본 과목은 지속가능성으로 대표되는 환경의 본질과 환경을 보호하고 개선하려는 정부
의 정책을 심도있게 다룸으로써 지속가능한 환경정책을 이해하는데 그 목적이 있다. 
본 과목을 성공적으로 이수하는 학생이라면 학기말에는 환경과 지속가능성에 대
한 ""정책 마인드""가 형성될 것으로 기대해도 좋다."
PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY ,"This subject deals primarily with Equilibrium Properties of Macroscopic Systems using basic thermodynamic principles. 
It also includes Chemical Reactions in gas and solution phases from the aspect of thermodynamics. 
The goal of this course is to provide fundamental understanding to handle basic problems involving chemical systems at equilibrium and rates of simple chemical reactions."
COGNITION IN SCIENCE AND RELIGION ,"Instructor: Philip S. Cho
Email: omegalambda.692@gmail.com
Skype: astroboy102

Course Description:
This course explores the cognitive foundations of religion and science. How do 
cognitive processes such as memory, attention, emotion, language, and 
embodiment shape the social reproduction of religious and scientific knowledge 
and practices? In turn, how do social, cultural, and even environmental 
contexts influence cognition? Does this complex dynamic between culture and 
cognition change over time and do any long-term patterns emerge from the 
history of religion and science? We will take a hands-on approach to these 
issues through neurophysiological and behavioural labs as well as a field 
trip. 

Learning Objectives:
1. Compare and critique the methodologies and claims of researchers in 
different disciplines studying cognition in science and religion. 
2. Reflect on how these methodologies and claims have changed within 
historical contexts. How have the disciplines studying science and religion 
changed?
3. Acquire basic knowledge in cognitive neuroscience and gain hands-on 
experience in different lab and field techniques.
4. Survey the history of science and religion in different cultures. 
5. Debate and communicate the findings and merits of various research 
approaches."
KOREAN LANGUAGE FOR HERITAGE STUDENTS ,"This is a writing and discussion-intensive course. After successful completion 
of this course, students are extect to write and discuss current issues with 
appropriate words, sentence endings, and speech styles.  

Studenjts who are interested in grammars are recommend to consider Advanced 
Korean class."
ASIAN ART AND CIVILIZATION ,
PERFORMANCE STUDY ,
ATLANTIC WORLD HISTORY ,"This course aims to introduce students to Atlantic world history by comparatively examining revolutionary change in British America, France, and Haiti, which upturned the Atlantic region between 1775 and 1848.  Known as the “Age of Revolutions,” the period saw a sustained assault on monarchical government, imperial rule, and aristocratic privileges associated with the early modern period. These revolutions, occurring within a relatively short period of each other, represented one of the most transitional moments in western civilisation as a violent movement toward modernity. This course seeks to provide an introduction not merely to broader frameworks of transnational history, but also to a range of methodological approaches in the study of social, cultural, political, and intellectual history. The course will chronologically investigate the entwined reasons for the collapse of the ancien r?gimes as well as the types of societies that followed.  

The interrelated connections between these revolutions invite questions about nation-based history as an adequate framework in which to analyze developments in the region. In doing so, the course challenges narratives of national exceptionalism by focusing on deeper underlying currents of change. These broader concepts still hold vital significance for contemporary society: freedom, violent conflict, liberty, sovereignty, democracy, and empire. A research-based approach to teaching and learning will be taken throughout, partly by drawing directly on the course tutor’s own research, and through a focus on the analysis of primary source material in each class."
PHILOSOPHY OF KNOWLEDGE ,"How do we know what we know? This is a perennial question of philosophy. In this class, we will study historical and contemporary theories of knowledge and related topics such as belief, evidence, and justification. The reading and discussion will center around questions such as: What is the nature of knowledge or justification? Is one’s justification entirely internal to one’s own mind? Are there things we can know without evidence? Are some things, perhaps, unknowable? We will consider how these questions were addressed by the ancient Greeks, early modern Europeans, and contemporary philosophers of knowledge."
HCI SEMINAR ,"This couse provides in-depth discussion about academic research papers in the area of Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience. 
As the course title implies, it is heavily focused on reading and discussion of academic papers. 
Students will read 2-3 academic papers per week and have in-depth discussion during the class."
CHINESE POLITICS AND SOCIETY ,"This course is an introductory survey of domestic politics of China, including background information on pre-1949 revolution processes, the era of 
Mao and the reform period since 1978. We will pay attention to history, political structures, economic reform and its consequences in China. 
The first part of the course will address the evolution of politics in China during the Mao years, including the revolution, the socialist economic 
transformation, mass campaigns, and the Cultural Revolution. The second part of the course will address formal political structures in post-Mao China such as structure of the CCP, central-local relations, and local government. The third part of the course will address issues on economic reform and 
its consequences in post-Mao China: the social, economic and political challenges posed by the economic reform. 
The class heavily depends upon students’ presentations and discussions."
AS LHP: GENDER IN MODERN JAPANESE HISTORY ,"This course explores history and culture of modern Japan from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, with a specific focus on transformations of gender relations. With the help of theoretical readings, students are expected to critically engage with a variety of primary and secondary sources to better understand gendered assumptions and heterosexual normativity implicated in these sources. In other words, the course deals with the constructed nature of historical narratives by using gender as an analytical lens and modern Japan as a case study. Though the course materials include a significant amount of women’s writings and films on women, the course is not strictly on women’s history. Rather, the course problematizes “women’s history” as a category of historical studies and seeks to provide multiple perspectives to study gender relations. From Week 2, the type of weekly topic alternates between the political and the cultural roughly in chronological order."
AS LHP: CULTURES OF GLOBALIZATION IN CHINA ,"The emergence of China from the late 1980s to the current moment challenges conventional thinking and taxonomy of the world as first, second, third; developing vs. developed; capitalist vs. socialist; or center and periphery. This course aims to achieve three goals. First, it will introduce dominant theoretical paradigms of transnationalism and globalization while appreciating the fact that global encounters between China and the rest of the world have long existed in transnational exchanges of people, goods, languages, and ideas. Second, we will look at various metaphors, models, and modes of concretization and abstraction that humanists, historians, and political scientists employ in their studies of globalization; in doing so, we come to more nuanced understanding of global phenomena as multi-sited, multidirectional, frictional, and perhaps even highly embodied. Finally, this course understands globalization as both processes of re-nationalization in China’s ever ambitious attempt at branding nationalism as well as one of flexible transnationalization. Some case studies in our examination of the cultures of globalization in China include but are not limited to the followings: the floating population and migrant workers; sex workers in urban cities; foreign investment and state’s (de)regulations in rule of law; global impact of China’s energy crisis; flexible practices of citizenship; transnational domestic workers; organ trade and human rights scandal; the privatization of blood bank and health care; Sino-African relations; and more generally the discourses about the “rise of China” and soft power."
MODERN KOREAN FICTION AND FILM ,"Excitement over liberation had hardly waned when United States and Soviet Union troops stormed into the Korean peninsula. Division along the 38th parallel was quick and hopes for an independent and unified Korea were shattered. This highly charged political atmosphere of 1945 set the terrain for a series of turbulent events that would define modern South Korea: the Korean War, partition, military dictatorship, democratization, and globalization.

This course examines how modern Korean fiction and film have provided the heart and conscience of South Korea by giving voice to and bearing witness to history’s devastations. Thus, to study modern Korean fiction and film is to engage with multiply layered and tortuously entwined narratives caught between the literary, the imaginary, and the historical--at the intersections of politics, aesthetics, and ethics.

We will explore a broad and disparate range of narratives to better understand how modern Korean fiction and film--as cultural products--plumb the themes of nation, gender, modernity, and post-modernity and how they navigate the global phenomenon known as the “Korean Wave” in Asia and the world--amid dynamic flux and metamorphosis. Theoretical texts and recent scholarship on modern Korea will supplement our “literary” readings."
THE LANDSCAPES OF VIOLENCE AND POLITICS ,"In this class we examine the ways in which violence and domination are related to physical space, whether this in the context of colonialism or the marginalized spaces of suffering in social life. Premised on the notion that who we are as political subjects is constructed in and through the symbolic and physical structures in which we live our everyday lives, this class explores issues of political action and protest through the lens of the physical landscapes in which suffering, oppression, domination, and colonialism are characteristic--and constitutive--features."
"AS LHP: SOVEREIGNTY AND NATIONALISM IN KOREA, 1894-1948 ","This semester, venturing beyond the temporal boundaries in the course title, we will attempt to get some purchase on the history and practice of sovereignty, governmentality, and nationalism in Korea, starting from the start of the Chos?n dynasty (1392-1910) to present day South Korea. The readings in the first half of the course will include theoretical works (e.g. Foucault’s 1977-1978 lectures at Coll?ge de France), and selections from T’aejo sillok (太宗實錄), Mongmin sims? (牧民心書), and 19th century court records. Readings for the second half of the course will focus on texts concerning sovereignty, governmentality, and nationalism in Korea from the late 19th century to the present. 

One aim of this course will be to see how (in what sense) sovereignty ? both national sovereignty and individual sovereignty ? can (or cannot) constitute the basis for freedom in modern times. Another aim will be to reconsider the relationship between nationalism and governmentality. While the focus of this course is predominantly on Korea, our readings and discussion will be attentive to regional and world history. Students are expected to read closely and to write in an analytical mode."
JAPANESE POLITICAL THOUGHT ,"This course aims to examine some of the profound thinkers and praxis of 
Japanese political thought in the Tokugawa and early Meiji era (17th to 19th 
centuries). There are several academic texts available on this topic, but we 
will primarily be focusing on the following reading material, A History of 
Japanese Political Thought, 1600-1901. Written by Watanabe Hiroshi (Tokyo: 
International House of Japan, 2012), the book is already one of the established 
classics of the field. Its original Japanese text is mostly based on lectures 
to undergraduates of University of Tokyo. Those who have no background 
knowledge of the subject may not find it too difficult to understand. By 
careful reading, we will explore various historical myths and be given much 
food for thought in many aspects. 
From the seventeenth to nineteenth century, Confucianism had been the nucleus 
of Japanese intellectual society and eventually played a crucial role in the 
Meiji Revolution (1868). Although there are differences in degree, Confucianism 
had enormous influence on East Asian countries, from politics to everyday life 
ethics. At the same time, there still remain many difficulties in the 
understanding of Confucianism due to different historical contexts. Through 
this course, we will examine those contexts. We will be looking at the days of 
the shogunate--the  Tokugawa family--, the modernizing revolution launched by 
samurai and the adoption of Western civilization on full scale in the late 
nineteenth century."
UX DESIGN AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT ,"This class applies management point of view to the UX design and IT service by 
combining theoretical and practial aspects of UX design and strategic 
mamagement. 

For the practice, students will develop UX Analysis Reports on the select 
service or the company. The project will be conducted as a team project (3~4 
members per team)."
현대디자인사 ,"현재 통용되고 있는 디자인 역사들은 대체로 서양을 중심으로 하는 사관에 입각해 있
다. 이것은 학문적이기 보다는 교조적인 현상이며, 우리가 극복해야 할 일이다.  그
래서 기존의 디자인 역사 서술의 한계를 분명히하고, 디자인 역사를 일반 역사 그리
고 철학, 사회, 문화, 예술적 관점에서 재검토한다. 그래서 궁극적으로는 서양 중심
의 디자인역사관을 넘어서는 역사관을 확보하도록 한다."
STUDIES IN ENGLISH LITERATURE ,"In this course, we will discuss five of Virginia Woolf’s novels and her long essay, A Room of One’s Own. Across these texts, we will examine Woolf’s approaches to representing consciousness ? sensation, cognition, memory ? and her theories of art, social relationships, and gender."
TOPICS IN SOCIAL THEORY ,"This undergraduate seminar provides an introduction to ""Emancipatory 
Sociology,"" by raising a question of ""Sociology for whom?""  This is a question 
we are attempting to answer in this class.  There are some traditions in 
sociology, which believe that sociology should exist for the less fortunate, 
more vulnerable, the oppressed.  They believe that this kind of view contains 
keys for changing society as well, changing it in the direction of less 
oppression, less exploitation and alienation.  We are reading the texts of 
this tradition – Marxism and Feminism."
FRENCH CINEMA ,"French Cinema: From the National to the Personal

This course examines the New Wave and its legacy, focusing on a few filmmakers 
who rose to prominence in the 1950s-60s while challenging cinematic 
conventions in multiple ways. We will meet the so-called “rats of the Cinematheque,” 
cinephiles like Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard who wrote criticism for 
the Cahiers du Cinema and turned filmmaking into critical practice. We will consider 
the New Wave`s legacy on later works of directors like Louis Malle and Claire Denis, 
who fused personal and political in semi-autobiographical tales that dealt 
with themes of occupation and colonialism. We may also look at Agnes Varda, 
Jacques Demy, and Jacques Tati, who all experimented with the cinematic form. 

We will discuss their works with a view to understanding how they challenged 
assumptions about how films should be made, presented, and viewed. As we do 
so, we will also reflect on the influence of Hollywood, filmmaking as critical 
practice, auteur theory, spectatorship, and national cinema itself while we 
examine styles, techniques, and themes. We will also view these filmmakers 
in a broader context as we consider how their work reflected a French society 
experiencing post-war ""prosperity"" but also coming to grips with the legacy 
of occupation, its own colonial past, and the forces of technology 
and globalization. 

As we examine this slice of French cinema and reflect on a legacy still felt 
today, we will tackle some broader questions: What is it about French 
cinema that has inspired filmmakers worldwide, including in Korea? 
What do these films show us about life in France in the 20th century? 
What do they have to say about what it means to be human anywhere? 
Can the personal and the political find expression in the cinema? Should they? 
And, for those with creative ambitions, what can we learn from these filmmakers 
who revitalized a medium that to some had reached a certain ""maturity?"""
COLONIAL HISTORY ,"From 1858 to 1954, the French government conquered, controlled and then lost, 
what it described as Indochina. The southeast Asian colonial possession 
included territory of the present-day countries of Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. 
The history of this colonial experience has long been overshadowed by the 
catastrophic history of war and genocide that followed the end of French colonial 
rule, including the Vietnam War--or the American War, 
depending on your perspective--and the Cambodian genocide. 

This seminar beings with a survey of the peoples, societies, and states in southeast 
Asia in the early nineteenth century, examines the initial French  conquest and 
Vietnamese responses to it, discusses colonial society from the perspective of colonizer 
and colonized, looks at the impact of war and  revolution on that colonial society, and 
concludes with the First Indochina war that resulted in the removal of the French.

We will read and discuss primary source documents such as political speeches, 
diplomatic correspondence, ethnographic maps, photographs, postcards, propaganda 
posters, memoirs, novels, poetry, and film. We will supplement these discussions with 
a wide variety of secondary sources that  approach the time period from the perspectives 
of political, social, economic, cultural and environmental history."
ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY ,"This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of abnormal psychology, including (1) definition of abnormality, (2) classification of 
psychological disorders and diagnostic criteria based on the DSM-IV-TR and the newest version, DSM-5, and (3) etiology of major psychological disorders such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and personality disorders. We will discuss the clinical characteristics of major psychological disorders through case studies and readings."
TOPICS IN DRAMATIC WRITING ,"Screenwriting: Scenes, Shorts, and Series

In this writing workshop, students will build a portfolio comprising short film scripts, 
new media scripts for the episodic form, or a half-hour comedy teleplay. 
With instructor permission, highly motivated students may develop a one-hour television 
drama or feature screenplay.   

After an introduction to the screenplay format, we`ll examine professional samples 
from screenplays & teleplays, supplementing these with various tools of the trade--
treatments (screen stories in prose form), pitch documents, etc.  We`ll also view 
filmed examples representing the range of forms where screenwriting can be applied--
e.g., short & feature films, episodic television, mockumentary, sketch comedy, 
and web series.  

The workshop portion of the course will depend on class size and student interest, 
but I aim for each student to have at least two opportunities to workshop their material 
during the semester. While you should have some idea of the stories and issues that you 
wish to explore from the first day of class, we won’t begin workshops until after Chuseok 
so you’ll have a couple weeks before committing to your projects. Depending on student 
interest, we may also use the television writers’ room as a framework--i.e., brainstorm 
ideas as a group with individual students writing scripts based on those ideas.  

By the end of the semester, each student will have a mini-portfolio of workshopped 
material that, with thoughtful and careful revision on the student’s part, is reasonably close 
to being shot or submitted professionally.  

Although the course is aimed at writers who wish to work in film/TV/new media, 
even those who don’t plan to write professionally may find that a screenwriting workshop 
can develop skills useful in any field, e.g. sensitivity to language, ability to write visually 
for emotional impact, and the capacity to give and receive constructive feedback, 
while also enhancing overall creativity."
DREAMS AND DREAM WRITING ,"From the ancient Greek and Chinese oracles and Taemong of Korea to the sofas 
of Freud and Jung to contemporary Yanomami shamans and Hollywood ""Dreamworks,"" 
throughout a vast array of cultures and eras, dreams have been a source of 
inspiration, healing and insight. In this course we aim to reconnect with the 
imaginative and therapeutic power of dreams primarily through writing our own, 
while reading extensively in dream literature."
THE LITERATURE AND CULTURE OF PEACE ,"This course is a multi-dimensional exploration of the concept and realization of Peace in all of its forms from basic Peace of Mind, Peace in the Womb, Peace for Children, Peace with Parents, Peace with Siblings and Friends, Community Peace, Inter-nation Peace (e.g. North and South Korea), and World Peace. It implements the world literature of the idea of Peace as it has evolved through the centuries in religion, philosophy, drama, song, poetry, short story, novel, essay, speeches, autobiography, social, economic and political documents, as well as practical forms of Peace meditation (spiritual) and mediation (NVC). Personal journals about the evolution of your thoughts about Peace during the term will be assigned. All students will be expected to read the assigned material before class and to speak out and participate full-heartedly in the class discussions and activities."
METHODS AND MODES OF FICTION WRITING ,"We will examine several fiction genres, stories, authors and themes to outline 
the range and depth of short fiction. It is of course impossible to survey 
the entire gamut of fiction, but this class will examine several of the main 
genre functions and some of its best proponents. We will be starting workshops 
soon after the start of the semester, in addition to lectures on the stories. 
The workshop schedule will be finalized once the class roster is finalized, 
and then you will be assigned particular dates for your stories. YOU MUST 
SUBMIMIT YOUR WORKSHOP MATERIALS A WEEK BEFORE YOUR WORKSHOP. FAILURE TO DO SO 
WILL IMPACT YOUR GRADE."
KOREAN FILM STUDIES ,"This course covers the history of Korean cinema of the last 100 years and examines 
its artistic content and contemporary cultural and social roles; ideally, it serves to develop 
your general intellectual capacities of the Korean motion picture industry. 

 Following a loose chronology, we`ll study the origin, development, and growth of Korean 
cinema from a variety of perspectives (e.g. social, cultural, global, technological and artistic 
standpoints) and discuss the evolution of specific trends, styles, and issues related to the 
Korean film industry. The course also outlines the history of the world and Hollywood cinema 
to illustrate their impact and influence on Korean cinema and vice versa.  

 By evaluating selected works that comprise each genre and a certain time period, not only do 
we trace the history of Korean cinema but its relationship to global popular culture, historical 
representation, and other mass media outlets, such as the music industry, TV, and advertising."
TOPICS IN THE COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE ,"This course will examine some major texts on the philosophy of nature. The selections from the works of David Bohm, David Albert, Graham Smethan, Alfred Whitehead, and others will be discussed with the critical lectures/discussions of the issues in the classical discussions of the East."
CRITICAL THEORY AND VISUAL CULTURE ,
COMPARATIVE DANTE: THE ORIGINAL AND THE TRANSLATIONS ,"In this course, Dante`s [Divine Comedy] will be read in parallel texts: Italian original with the English translations, now available in superb web projects as well as in books. As the students follow the multi-layered narrative of the great work via the translations, all the while comparing the different versions of them, the professor will explain the wonders of Dante`s original composition. Through this division of labor, the students will have the rare opportunity of experiencing the iconic masterpiece in its entirety, of appreciating the beauty of its language, and of becoming sensitive to the peculiarities of English as a motley tongue that Dante would have found appalling."
빅토리아문학과문화 ,"This course explores the literary representation of Victorian women and men 
under the governing culture of law. From married women’s status under the 
common law as feme couvert and thus subsumed under the husband’s existence, 
to multiple legal codes governing single women’s claims to property and legal 
representation, women faced an uncertain legal existence during the Victorian 
era. The course of the nineteenth century did witness several significant 
reforms in the legal code, and we will use the law as a stepping-stone from 
which to track the impact of legal, cultural, and social factors on individual 
choices and personal relations. Our selected novels depict women and men in 
acute circumstances, with their personal and romantic choices often oblivious 
of, and yet constrained by, a larger legal context."
산업조직론 ,
EAST ASIA IN THE 20TH CENTURY ,"Recent political tensions between Japan and its neighboring countries tell us how ""history"" can become a primary driving force for international disputes in East Asia. The nationalist appropriation of historical memories of war, violence, and colonial rule has always posed a challenge to international and internal reconciliation and mutual recognition. History is not simply what we know about the past but how we know the past, and to learn history is to unravel how politics and power relations are inscribed in our understanding of the past. In this course, we will discuss the politics of collective memory, the question of historical archives, and the relationship between struggles over historical memory and political legitimacy on the international stage.

The course focuses particularly on the collective memory of war and violence in twentieth century East Asia. Through an examination of contemporary battles over history in the realm of textbooks, commemoration, and reconciliation, we will consider how we can create a language with which to describe, judge, and act upon past violence. Who makes historical narratives of violence? Who decides what is just? How have people challenged nationalized narratives? What is at stake in these conflicts? Throughout the course, we will discuss these critical questions by engaging with the major controversies over historical sites and events in East Asia."
NORTH KOREAN POLITICS AND PROPAGANDA ,"In North Korea, all information is propaganda, sanctioned and overseen by the state to promote military, government and Workers’ Party policy. Journalists, artists, musicians and actors are required by the state to convey the party’s message through their articles, songs and films. In this course, we learn how North Korea uses popular mass media to promote the party’s propaganda, and we analyze the political, economic and cultural history of North Korea through its propaganda. An important component to deciphering North Korea’s propaganda is learning how to look at propaganda critically and skeptically. And in South Korea, which has its own state-imposed restrictions on North Korean propaganda, we learn how to access and interpret North Korean propaganda legally to further understanding of North Korea, its history, its people and its political system."
EUROPEAN UNION ,
ISRAEL: POLITICS AND SOCIETY ,
THE TWO KOREAS ,"This seminar explores one simple question: What makes the two Koreas, North 
and South, so different after the natinal division and the Korean War more than 
sixty years ago? 
It examines this question by highlighting and explaining the defining 
characterisㅅics of the both systems in the context of their respective 
political change, economic development, national security, human rights and 
response to globalization."
INTERNATIONAL REGIMES IN GLOBAL POLITICS ,
국제정의론 ,"This course is designed to analyze and discuss major ideas and theories of international justice or global justice. It covers Kant`s idea of perpetual peace, Rawls`s liberal conception of international justice in The Law of Peoples, contemporary cosmopolitan theories, and Confucian conception of international justice. 
	As globalization deepens, we witness that the relations between states or political societies grow more complex, thus causing conflicts more complicated between political societies and peoples. Moreover, global issues such as economic inequality and poverty, environment problems, nuclear problem tend to get more and more serious. In order to cope with these conflicts and global problems, there have been theoretical debates on internal or global justice. This course is aimed to help students understand major theoretical debates on international justice  or global justice.
	Specifically, in this semester, we employ as main texts Kant`s Perpetual Peace, Rawls`s The Law of Peoples, and Walzer`s Just and Unjust Wars. For the sake of convenient class proceeding, each week students are supposed to read proper chapters of the book along with other supporting materials relevant to the week`s topic."
SOCIAL INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE DATA II ,"This course explains what computer is and what it can (and can’t) do. It describes the basics of information technology, from PC and smart phones to the Internet and beyond. The 2nd goal of this course is to illustrate how computers and networks are used to as practical tools to solve a wide variety of problems and extend human capabilities in all kinds of new directions. This course puts technology in a human context, illustrating how our ever-growing network of digital devices affects our lives, our world, and our future."

Spectroscopic structural analysis of organic molecules"
BIOCHEMISTRY (1) ,"This course provides a foundational understanding of the principles and mechanisms of biochemical reactions in living organisms, focusing on the major classes of biomolecules."
JUNIOR SEMINAR(ISED SCIENCE SEMINAR ON THE HEART) ,"Understanding heart  requires almost every aspect of science from cellular scale to organic scale to fully appreciate its beautiful mechanism 
without which a life cannot sustain even for a bit of time. 
Thus, studying the heart is very challenging, but can be very interesting and inspiring to curious and bright minds. 
In the beginning, this course provides an overall introduction on the scientific studies of the heart in views of cardiology and electrophysiology. 
After that, each student chooses a topic according to his/her interest and carries on an independent research  throughout this semester 
with the consults and discussion with the instructor and classmates. 
The formal goal of this course is to produce individual research paper as possibly the first research activity in the University environment, 
but the final goal is to experience what the actual research could be and what we need to carry on research for the way we may choose. 
Besides appreciating the beauty of the heart, additional benefits of this course can be

(1) To increase research capacity.
(2) To improve presentation skills.
(3) To improve scientific writing.

Class time could be rescheduled according to the students` convenience."
"혁신,창업과정책 ","Innovation and entrepreneurship have been regarded as sources for
economic vitality and growth. A recent success of the
Silicon Valley is a good example. This course will introduce
literature on innovation and entrepreneurship. Also it will review
policy options for Government from a comparative perspective."
INTRODUCTION TO WRITING POETRY ,"There is no such thing as a wrong question, but there is such a thing as a bad 
poem. Bad poetry is usually poetry written in haste, sloppily, and with very 
little thought. Like the Edison diatribe, 1 percent inspiration, ninety-nine 
percent perspiration, great poetry and poets are measured by the weight of the 
labor they put behind their work.  Like the value of a suit or dress can be 
measured by the quality of materials and craftsmanship of the tailoring, poems 
can be measured by craft and content. There are equally great poems about 
wheelbarrows as their are poems about war. Great poetry can come from the smallest of 
things. While I don’t expect everyone to be producing work of great genius, 
students will learn how to identify good materials and learn craftsmanship and 
are expected to produce accordingly.   
    A poem may travel on any number of vessels and can take many forms, but it is 
extremely rare for a poem to be finished in one sitting.  Poems usually find 
their form through a process of revision that takes the course of several 
months, years, decades or a lifetime. With that in mind, this class will be 
primarily dedicated to the process of revision. Students will be asked to write 
a small group of poems refined over the course of the semester. As poems are 
most often found grouped together in collections, books, or projects, we will 
also study how poems press up against each other and become unified by a common 
style and theme."
TOPICS IN KOREAN ART ,"This course is designed to develop students’ critical thinking skills through learning Korean art history, with focus on the images of women from the Joseon Dynasty and Modern period.  We will also discuss the role of women not only as objects of paintings but also as subjects such as painters and patrons in Korean art. By the end of the course, students will be able to convey their creative thoughts about art using various analytical tools and learn to express their ideas effectively both verbally and in writings. Each lecture will present images of the artifacts and students must be prepared to use the required readings to discuss the objects within their philosophical, social, and cultural context. In this class, students will have a heavy reading requirement, several writing assignments, and presentations."
THE HISTORY OF SEXUALITY ,"This course examines the “discovery” and transformation of sexuality in modern Europe.  What norms or expectations governed the way women and men interacted in the pre-modern world, and how did those change with the Enlightenment and industrialization?  Where, when, and how did sexuality become an attribute used to define personhood and identity?  How did issues such as demography, disease, prostitution, contraception, or sexual “perversion” become preoccupations for state and other corporate entities?  The seminar will explore these and related themes using an array of primary and secondary sources, including literature, art, and film."
MAJOR PHILOSOPHERS ,"In this course, we will read the entirety of _Ethics_, the major work of the 17th century Dutch Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Spinoza is most well-known in for his controversial doctrine that God is nothing more than Nature itself - the world as a whole. In the _Ethics_, Spinoza argues for this view, and for a comprehensive vision of human nature, ethics, and religion centered on this fundamental doctrine. As we read through the _Ethics_, we wil attempt to understand this comprehensive vision, and Spinoza`s arguments for it. As we do so, we will take a particular interest in a very influential interpretation of Spinoza`s thought, developed by the 20th century French philosophy Gilles Deleuze. Thus, alongisde the _Ethics_, we will read extracts from Deleuze`s two books on Spinoza, as well as from various Deleuze`s seminar transcripts."

POWER AND MARGINALITY IN POST-SOCIALIST CHINA ,"This course is intended to understand the political changes and their social impact in contemporary China. From Deng`s reform to today`s Xi regime, the class will examine the differing positions of China`s power shifts, particularly between neoliberalism and socialist conservatism. Students will be able to comprehend the underlying significance of the Chinese government`s policies in terms of the CCP`s historical orientations and political tension. In addition, a reflection on the margin of China`s politics such as Hong Kong and Taiwan would illuminate the possibility of political transformation in the greater China."
"SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY IN EAST ASIA ","The course aims to survey the history of science and technology in East Asian countries?China, Japan and Korea?since the late 19th century. Since Japan was the only nation in East Asia that succeeded in modernizing itself by adopting Western science, technology and politics, it will be studied first. The Chinese and Korean cases then will be reviewed with different angles. The course will emphasize the mutual influence between science & technology and society to answer how these countries became major industrial powers in the 21st century."
NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT ,"-Students develop a new service for the senior following the latest design process used by global design consulting firms.

-Students achieve the capabilities that designers or product(service) managers should be qualified for; finding customer insights, generating creative ideas, making logical decisions, communicating with others, planning marketing activities, making effective presentations."
DISTINGUISHED VISITING FACULTY SEMINAR ,TBA
ADVANCED FICTION WORKSHOP ,"The course, like most creative writing courses, revolves around the workshop experience. Each student will have their short story workshopped twice during the semester for a period of around 25 minutes. If you do not turn in your short story on time, you forfeit your right to a workshop. You will submit your short story on the designated day so students can read and write comments on your story (or on a separate piece of paper, or both) and submit it to you (if submitted electronically) before class. If comments have been written on the paper, this should be submitted directly to the student after class. Everyone will know who is up for workshop on each day; if you do not receive a student’s story, it is your responsibility to ask the said student to resend their story to you. Students whose stories have been workshopped will email a list of students who gave them comments to my T.A. by the end of the week.
This system requires you to be a generous, thoughtful reader of student stories. Reading and trying to understand stories in progress will help you become a more sensitive reader and writer in the long run, so please put in the effort and be an active workshop participant."
TRANSLATION OF ASIA THROUGH FILM ,"Imagining Gender in Korean Film

How are notions of gender--femininity, masculinity, and in-between--represented and negotiated in film? How does film visualize the ways in which ideologies of power, desire, and discipline intersect with gender? What does film tell us about the different historical and socio-cultural constructions of gender and the ""pathologies"" of such constructions? How are contemporary debates surrounding gender reflected in, informed by, and imagined across the popular cultural medium of film?

From the ""traditional"" wise-mother, good-wife (hyonmoyangch`o) to the ""modern"" new woman (sinyosong), from the colonial ""comfort woman"" to the neo-colonial ""western princess,"" from the post-War ""militaristic man"" to the post-IMF ""emasculated man,"" from the domestic housewife to the global foreign bride, this course explores how (r)evolving constructions of gender are molded, disseminated, altered, and subverted in (South) Korean film.

With the understanding that film--as a cultural product--cannot exist in a vacuum, we will consider a wide array of films amid the major upheavals and transformations of Korea. While South Korea appears to have made remarkable strides toward gender equality, entrenched ""normative"" values about gender (and sex and sexuality) continue to haunt and injure its society. Our aim is to critically excavate and question issues of gender so as to foster positive and ethical change."
NARRATIVE FILMMAKING WORKSHOP ,"This introductory course will expose students to the key considerations 
involved in creating narrative (story-based) films while they apply lessons 
learned in the classroom to the production of three digital video shorts.
In class, we will watch and critique student exercises, short films from 
around the world, and clips from classic & contemporary features--some good, 
some bad, some even a little weird, but all conducive to engaging classroom 
discussion. Our discussions will be complemented by readings that enhance 
student understanding of the thought processes and practical considerations 
involved in narrative filmmaking--shot selection and progressions, elements of 
dramatic narrative, working with actors, etc. We may also turn on the camera 
for in-class demonstrations.

This course is geared toward low-/no-budget filmmaking in consideration of 
equipment constraints and for pedagogical reasons--it`s not about fancy sets 
or costumes, and it`s not about who can spend the most money. This course 
aims to strip filmmaking to the essentials, providing a safety net for 
beginning filmmakers as they learn how to service a story through 
manipulation of the moving image.

Even those don`t intend to work in film may find that what they learn in 
this course can be applied to other fields. Although I hope that 
students will take the course out of a pure interest in filmmaking, some may 
find that enhancing their abilities to work with narratives, analyze human 
behavior, engage in creative problem solving, provide constructive criticism, 
and work productively in groups can be useful not only in film and other 
media, but also in diplomacy, business, and law."
ADVANCED JAPANESE (1) ,"This course is the first semester of advanced Japanese, and is designed to 
advanced students to greater strengths in oral communication competences and 
linguistic knowledge of Japanese. The detailed instructional objectives and 
contents of the course are twofold: (1) to solidify the grammar, vocabulary and 
kanji foundation built during the study at the beginning and intermediate; (2) 
to expend four language skills and the socio-cultural knowledge they need for 
communication, thereby easing their transition into advanced Japanese."
DRAMATIC WRITING ,"In this course, we will practice the craft of writing for film, television 
and theater. While drafting monologues, dialogues, scenes, scenarios and 
treatments, we will read a variety of plays, TV scripts and film screenplays. 
We will also watch and analyze live and recorded interpretations of these 
texts to learn (1) the art of storytelling on stage and screen; and (2) the 
traditional rules of dramatic construction (and how to break them). As a final 
project, each student will write either a one-act play, TV script on spec OR 
the first act of an original feature-length screenplay. Along the way we will 
perform our work and provide constructive feedback and moral support during 
critique sessions."
POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURE IN ENGLISH ,"This course is designed to expose undergradate students to 
diverse texts loosely grouped under the category of postcolonial
literature. We will start with two movies about Australian aborigines
and how this racial Other is portrayed. Then we will compare 
these movies with another movie about South African whites and 
blacks under the apartheid years. After or between 
these movie sessions, we will proceed to read stories by Nadine 
Gordimer and J. M. Coetzee, the Nobel laureates of 1991 and 2003, 
along with one by La Guma. We are going to raise and attempt to 
answer fundamental questions concerning the relationship between 
novel and society, such as how society influences literature and how 
the latter responds to the former. Then we will turn to another issue 
of Western representation of Asian, another hot issue in literary criticism 
of today. We will discuss a work by Chang-rae Lee in the context of 
Korean American legacy and global literature."
TOPICS IN THE COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHY OF CULTURE ,"This course will examine some major texts on the philosophy of culture with special emphasis on the status of science in western tradition. The selections from the works of/on Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Derrida, Bohr, Heisenberg, Einstein and others will be discussed."
서양고전강독 ,"This course offers a comparative study and close reading of the major heroic 
epics of ancient Greece and Rome: Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey (Greece), and 
Virgil’s Aeneid (Rome). We will be discussing some key topics: the warrior 
ethic, the distinction between kleos (glory) and time (honor), heroic 
friendship, of nostos (homecoming), fate and the gods, oral vs. written 
poetry, 
the social function of epic, myth and epic, and the changing nature of 
heroism. 
We will also explore more closely the themes of rebribution and justice, as 
they are very starkly presented in Aeschylus`s _Agamemnon_, and of human and 
divine concepts of justice in Sophocles`s _Antigone_."
공공및정치경제 ,"In this class we will study how a government makes decisions and what decisions it should make. This leads us to a variety of interesting topics such as political processes, tax policies, and so on. For example, to enact a government policy, citizens must elect the party that will take charge of the government. A typical method of election is the majority voting, which begets interesting questions: when each citizen has a different preference from each other, what will be the outcome of the majority voting? Will the outcome be efficient? If not, how can we restore efficiency in electing the government? We will study these interesting topics in this class, using economic models."
나노생명공학 ,"Nanobiotechnology is a new frontier for biology with important applications in 
medicine. It bridges areas in physics, chemistry, and biology and is a 
testament to the new areas of interdisciplinary science that will become 
dominant in the twenty-first century. This course provides perspective for 
students and researchers who are interested in nanoscale physical and 
biological systems and their applications in medicine. It introduces concepts 
in nanofabrication and nanomaterials."
AMERICAN ELECTIONS AND CAMPAIGNS ,"This course is aimed at learning elections and campaigns of the United States. We will cover how the institutions and rules determine candidates, votes and even results. With the fascinating and surprising result of the presidential election 2016, we will have ample subject to discuss, but this time we will be more academic and theoretical to evaluate the election."
POLITICS OF REGIONAL COOPERATION IN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES ,"This course is designed to explore how states in International Politics maximize their efforts to cooperate with each other. The course will look at the underlying mechanism affecting the ways that states behave in different regions and issues areas. Cooperation is the way to minimize the probability of conflict while maximizing each state`s interest. The course will deal with security, economy and non-traditional security areas where states work together, if not compete."
THEORY AND PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ,"The course introduces core international relations theories and how they apply to historical and contemporary case studies. It introduces Realism and Neo-Realism, Liberalism and Neo-liberalism, Marxism, Critical Theory, English School, Constructivism, Feminism, Green Politics, Post-Modernism, as well as several other lesser known theoretical approaches. Each theory is studied within the context of historical and contemporary case studies with the ultimate aim of understanding how theory can be used describe, explain, or predict the international relations of the Korean peninsula."
FUNDAMENTALS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM ,"Overview  

“Constitutionalism” is loosely defined as a group of ideas, attitudes, and behavior presenting the principle that the authority of government derives from and is limited by a body of fundamental law.  This course will provide an overview of the primary law of the United States (The Constitution) and its origins that make up the principles of “Constitutionalism”.  It will examine the source and limits of governmental power, including an overview of the relationships among the states, the states and the federal government, and the three branches of the federal government. 

This course will rely heavily on older as well as recent U.S. Supreme Court cases to examine the important relationships listed above.  
Please note that this syllabus is subject to change.

Goals

The students will develop a strong understanding of the origins of the United States Constitution and the ensuing U.S. Supreme Court decisions that form the bedrock of “Constitutionalism” within the context of the United States Constitution."
"CITIZENS, LAW AND POLICYMAKING ","This course will provide an overview of public policy making in the United States,
focusing primarily on the role and influence of citizens on the numerous regulations and laws
that govern our everyday lives through voting, rulemaking and protests."
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW ,"This class is an introductory course to the principles of American contract law as supported by casebook handouts (TBA), supplements, and in-class discussion. 
Please note that this syllabus is subject to change.

The students will develop a strong foundation of the principles and concepts of American contract law and be able to apply these principles and concepts to both  hypothetical and real-world fact scenarios."
THE RULE OF LAW IN THEORY AND PRACTICE ,
POLICY ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION ,Students will learn general theories and techniques on policy-making process and evaluation. Also the class introduces real-life examples on public policy and students will learn an analytical framework to understand the daily operation of government and publc sector.

HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL BRAIN ,"We humans are social creatures and our brains are wired to connect with other people. 
In this course, we will discuss how social humans are both in terms of behavior and brain. We have two main goals. The primary goal is to 
understand the fundamentals of human behavior in social context. We will cover some selected topics in social psychology. The secondary goal 
is to explore the neural basis of social behavior. We will review social neuroscience research findings that correspond to topics covered in class. 
This second goal seeks to promote our knowledge of how human brains respond to the social world. 
	
This course is designed to parallel social psychology. Both cover the topics of how people think, feel, and behave in social situation. However, 
there is an important difference. In comparison with typical social psychology course, students will have more opportunities to explore the neural 
mechanisms of the social mind. We will focus on recognizing implications of neural correlates of social behavior. There will be less emphasis on 
physiology and anatomy of the nervous system. Thus, this course is not intended for those with strong academic interests on brain anatomy, 
biological mechanisms, and structural/functional aspects of the nervous system."
CULTURE AND SOCIAL INNOVATION ,"The course is designed to introduce very basic concepts in medical anthropology and health care policy.
We will cover basic concepts/theoretical backgrounds of bio-cultural approaches, explorations of elder care and dementia as a field of research,
different cases from various parts of the world, field visits/field research, and possibilities for social innovation."
NANO MICRO FABRICATION TECHNIQUES ,"Microfabrication and nanofabrication are the basis of manufacturing for nearly all modern miniaturized systems that are ubiquitously used in our daily life. Examples include; computer chips and integrated sensors for monitoring our environment, cars, mobile phones, medical devices and more. In this engineering course, we will go a step beyond classroom teaching to not only explain the basics of each fabrication step but also show you how it’s done through video sequences and zooming into the equipment."
COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH FOR NANO AND ENERGY TECHNOLOGY ,"Many relevant case studies from fundamental research and industrial applications of advanced materials to nano and energy technologies will be used to exemplify the concepts taught. Our final goal will be to utilize modern computational models and simulation to help examine and understand the properties of nano and energy materials (e.g. electronic, magnetic and optical devices, sensors, catalysts and hard coatings). The materials presented in this course will focus primarily on the conceptual (chemical-physical) content while keeping the mathematical level basic, appropriate to the broad audience."
암발달생물학 ,"This is the second course in a two course series. Topics include 
tumorigenesis, maintenance of genomic integrity, angiogenesis, metastasis, 
tumor immunology and immunotherapy, and cancer treatment."
WORLD LITERATURE: CLASSICAL LITERATURE ,"The course will provide an introduction to Greek tragedy and the major theories of the tragic. In particular, we will focus on Aeschylus’ Oresteia, Sophocles’ Oedipus the King, Euripides’ Medea, and nineteenth- and twentieth-century theories of the tragic (from German Idealism and Arthur Schopenhauer to Søren Kierkegaard, Georg Simmel, Walter Benjamin, and Peter Szondi)."
DESIGN HISTORY ,"The purpose of this course is to provide a general approach to the history of design from the mid 19th century to the present by illustrating its movements in relation to the media development, socio-cultural changes, schools, and institutions, together with the designers who have set up the evolution and the trends in contemporary design. Design history stimulates students to explore the different historical events, artistic media, technological changes and various philosophical theories, so as to furnish them with the cognitive and methodological tools they need to locate their works in a broader social, economic and cultural phenomena. By analyzing designed artifacts and documents, the course will outline the key features of the history of design in the last one hundred and fifty years, with a particular focus on its influence on the Korean Design History.

General objectives:
1) To teach students the fundamental theoretical and historiographical topics of design from mid 19th century to the present day.
2) To orient students to use methodological tools and develop their analytical and critical capacities to link the different designs artifacts with each socio-cultural-historical background. 
3) To develop their analytical and critical abilities, focusing on their search for their expressive design language."
AS LHP: COLD WAR IN EAST ASIA ,"We begin by looking at how the Cold War was a global conflict that created mutually hostile, politically and culturally divided zones. This conflict mobilized just about everyone: for example, from black jazz musicians who were sent all over the world (by the U.S. State Department) to win hearts and minds, to middle class American families that adopted Korean “orphans,” to Korean writers who rendered the other half of Korea “invisible.”   

We will be reminded that the Cold War in East Asia involved “hot” wars that tore apart land, flesh, as well as neighborly trust. Here, our point of departure will be the collapse of the Japanese empire in 1945, and the collision between American and Soviet interventions on the one hand and local political movements on the other. 

Keeping in mind the historical situations in which communist and anti-communist regimes were established and consolidated, we will examine key events, ideas, and practices that establish(ed) strict limits on cultural and political expression, and sustained “war politics” on the Korean peninsula. We will end the course by looking at the aftermath of communism, and Koreans who live astride state borders in post-socialist East Asia."
EVERYDAY COMPUTING AND THE INTERNET ,"In order to make informed decisions in this information age, everyone needs to have an efficient way to sift through and evaluate the myriads of information that is available through the Internet. The ultimate objective of this course is to help students develop a “computational” state of mind for everyday events. Specifically, the course will enable students to answer the following questions: What daily problems need to be solved by a computational method? Are such problems solvable? By what means can such problems be solved? Is it worthwhile to compute such problems? How do all these problems relate to the Internet that we use on a daily basis? We will also discuss intensively the societal impacts of computing technologies on our daily life. The course will be taught with minimal levels of mathematical and technical detail (Same as CCST 9003 in HKU)."
INFORMATION SCIENCE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP ,
SMART SERVICE SYSTEMS ,"This course aims to help students acquire ability to develop a smart service system. In this semester, students will be able to access web services, run web servers, build web service systems, and extend the systems to smart service systems for community welfare. This advanced course is to provide the undergraduate students at CTM, with an opportunity to apply data science to web services."

VISUAL SOCIOLOGY ,"The course will first offer a theoretical overview of this burgeoning field through 
Douglas Harper’s textbook Visual Sociology and John J. Macionis’s textbook Sociology, 
along with several other readings. The course will require students to utilise their eyes 
and also carry out projects that involve doing actual ethnographic research with subjects 
while utilising cameras. There will be an American-style midterm examination and a 
final project/paper. Students will gain an exposure to recent and current sociological theories, 
as well as a review of traditional theories within the field. This course will be an excellent 
partial review of the basics of the field for majors, while offering a crucial new perspective 
on the field that is often not represented in more traditional approaches to the teaching of Sociology. 

This course is designed for students who want to  gain an exposure to recent and

“Visual Sociology” (시각사회학). This course is indeed “Visual Sociology” in the
sense that the production of photographic images is the central means of producing 
knowledge about social subjects, all within the context of ethnographic research. 
This course focuses on the new and evolving sub-specialty of sociology that relies on 
or uses visual data to make social analysis. The course considers photographs 
as visual texts that also act as social texts.

MORAL PSYCHOLOGY ,"Where do our beliefs about right and wrong come from? What factors influence our decisions on whether an action is moral or immoral? Can science contribute to our understanding of our beliefs about right and wrong? Or is morality a separate sphere that science can never fully explain? We will explore these questions by examining central empirical studies in the cognitive sciences on how we form moral beliefs, make moral decisions, and engage in moral reasoning. Specific topics for this course include: whether moral beliefs are innate or the result of learning; to what extent moral decisions are based on reasoning or emotions; whether evolutionary theory can explain our moral attitudes about altruism, sexual promiscuity, and other topics; and whether our natural propensity to act self-interestedly places limits on our duties to help others. We will also investigate the influence on moral decision-making of factors that are typically outside our conscious reflective control, including the potential influence of relatively unconscious, implicit attitudes towards different genders, races, religions and sexual orientations. By the end of this course you will be familiar with a variety of provocative, contemporary debates in moral psychology that seek to challenge?or at least provide a new perspective on?our ordinary ways of thinking about what is good, what is right, and how we have come to hold the moral beliefs we do."
ECONOMIC HISTORY OF KOREA AND JAPAN ,"COURSE DESCRIPTION
This is a reading, writing, and discussion-intensive course that examines the 
development of modern Korea and Japan in the twentieth century. 
Using a combination of lecture and class discussion, we will examine the facts 
and arguments surrounding the postwar transitions of Korea and Japan from colonialism and imperialism, respectively, to democratic and capitalist development within the context of both East Asia and the Cold War. We will pay special 
attention to the dominant arguments surrounding key moments of historical 
debate in modern Korean and Japanese history.

COURSE OBJECTIVES
By the end of the course, you should be able to:
-recognize the basic terms, key figures, and general concepts in this period 
of history
-understand the role of capitalism & imperialism in this period of Korean & 
Japanese history
-define and discuss issues in the methodology of Korean studies
-critically read and question an author’s perspective and the main points of 
their argument"
MODERN FRENCH HISTORY ,"In an occupied society, why do some choose to collaborate, others choose to resist, and still others just try to survive? This seminar will use everyday life in Vichy France as a case study for understanding ordinary people’s experience of defeat, collaboration, resistance, and liberation. Readings will consider the fall of France, the exodus, state collaboration, armed and civilian resistance, the challenges of daily life, French and German deportation of Jews, and the postwar purges. Weekly assignments will include sections from one historical monograph or novel, plus several short articles and book chapters, as well as a feature film or documentary. In our discussions, students will also be encouraged to think comparatively, either geographically (to other occupation regimes in Europe or East Asia), or chronologically (to the other world war). Individual students will act as discussion leaders and each will be expected to write weekly response papers and an 8-10 page final essay."
ADVANCED JAPANESE (2) ,"This course is the first semester of advanced Japanese, and is designed to 
advanced students to greater strengths in oral communication competences and 
linguistic knowledge of Japanese. The detailed instructional objectives and 
contents of the course are twofold: (1) to solidify the grammar, vocabulary and 
kanji foundation built during the study at the beginning and intermediate; (2) 
to expend four language skills and the socio-cultural knowledge they need for 
communication, thereby easing their transition into advanced Japanese."
WORLD WAR I: GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ,"The First World War has been called ""the seminal catastrophe of the twentieth century."" Though traditionally accounts of this conflict have been dominated by the experience of the Western Front, this seminar will go beyond the trenches and examine the conflict from a global perspective. After beginning with a survey of the war`s origins and outbreak, we will analyze the impact of the war on Africa, the Middle East, East Asia and Russia, as well as the experience of European civilians and soldiers, and will conclude with a discussion of the war`s aftermath. We will read and discuss primary source documents such as diplomatic correspondence, political speeches, oral histories, eyewitness accounts, propaganda posters, cartoons, memoirs, novels, poetry, and film. We will supplement these discussions with a wide variety of secondary sources that approach the conflict from the perspectives of military, political, social, economic, cultural and environmental history."
BIBLICAL LITERATURE AND THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST ,"This course will deal with one of the two pillars of the western civilization; the Ancient Near East including  the Biblical(Hebraic) World! However, you will realize by the end of the semester that this ANE civilization and culture are none other than the first human accomplishment, which later on paved 
a way for the rise of Western Civilization. It will seek to introduce the history and literature of the ANE in relation with the Bible to the students; 
Egyptology, Hittitology, Assyriology, and if possible, Minoan civilization in ancient Greek in passing. 
The course will be operative with the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) in mind, as the Biblical narratives (such as creation story, prophecy, and 
historical books) are relatively well known to the intellectuals; the students would be able to compare the Biblical records (narratives, poems, prophecy, and historiography) with the corresponding ANE texts in academic terms by locating them within the world of the ANE.
The goal of the course is to give students a balanced view on the roots of western civilization; Hebraic (in the context of ANE) and Greek worlds.It is 
deemed timely as the world we know it is now struggling to solve potential conflicts between seemingly different civilizations, in particular, 
between Jewish/Christian and Islamic persuasions. The understanding of the common motives and roots of both the eastern and western civilizations
will contribute to a more harmonious development of human history.
Besides the ancient literature, you would be given an opportunity to learn some of the ancient languages necessary for the study, though 
on introductory levels.
You will be exposed to such a few semitic languages and pictorial signs as 
Classical Hebrew, Akkadian(cuneiform), and Hieroglyph (Ancient Egyptian)."
HISTORY OF CHINA: TIME AND SPACE ,"The 10th through 13th centuries are often called ""The Chinese Renaissance."" 
This was a time of unprecedented economic growth, technological innovation, 
and ambitious domestic and foreign policy. At the same time, intense 
philosophical questioning led to the growth of Neo-Confucianism, the most 
influential form of Confucianism in East Asia today. While traditional 
historians have portrayed this period as a tragic low point in “Chinese” 
military power, more recently it has come to be seen as an exciting time of 
material prosperity and cultural transformation. 
In this course we will examine how these trends fit together, and how they 
affected the lives of both famous and ordinary people. Through the reading of 
both famous and lesser-known literary works, we will also explore how people 
living in this era described their own experiences. By the end of the course, 
students will be better able to understand multiple ways of talking about a 
society, as well as evaluating the evidence used to support alternative views."
ADVANCED STUDIES IN POETRY ,"American Women`s Poetry

In this seminar, we will read poetry by a variety of female American poets, beginning with Emily Dickinson and ending with Adrienne Rich and Maya Angelou. In class, we
will primarily conduct close readings of the poetry, but we will also engage with some of the contemporary criticism dealing with the poets."
STUDIES IN MODERN EUROPEAN LITERATURE ,"The 19th-century French novelist Gustave Flaubert famously aspired to write novels “about nothing.” He inaugurated a uniquely modern form of literature: novels that derive their intrigue not from sensational plots and extraordinary protagonists, but instead from closely observed descriptions of the everyday experiences of common or, indeed, socially marginal characters. In this course, we will examine 20th-century French novels that take a radical approach to Flaubert’s proposition. Informed additionally by Freud’s revelations about the dramas of psychic life, the novels we will read develop distinctive ways of conceiving of and depicting psychological interiority. 

We will spend first half of the semester on the Proustian “revolution” in the writing of subjectivity. The four remaining authors (much shorter novels) tackle interiority?and attendant questions of gender, class, the problem of alienation, the meaning of freedom?from perspectives representative of major intellectual currents in 20th-century French thought: Surrealism, Existentialism, the New Novel, Oulipo, and Marxism."
TOPICS IN COMPARATIVE HISTORY ,"In this course we explore both mainstream and revisionist explanations for both industrialization and the emergence of modern science in modern Europe. In parallel, we examine the forms of economic growth, technological development, mass-produced texts, and understandings of the natural world that emerged in China. These comparisons help us understand better why the changes in both contexts occurred, and thereby shed light on the dynamics at work in society today."
THE EPIC NOVEL ,"As George Lukacs famously put it, the novel is the epic of the modern age in which epic totality is no longer possible.  Yet, as Lukacs immediately would add, not all novels deserve that honour of standing in for the epic.  In this course we will be reading two great (in quantity as in quality) novels which veritably embody an epic totality of the modern world--with all its inevitable contradictions and idealism. Some eminent theorists of the novel, including Lukacs, will also be included in the reading list. Works to be read this semester are Honore de Balzac`s [Lost Illusions] and Leo Tolstoy`s [Anna 
Karenina].  English translations will be used but a knowledge of the original language would no doubt be welcome."
"POETRY, DRAMA AND PERFORMANCE ","Poetry, Drama, and Performance walks students through the basics of poetry and 
drama, paying special attention to the sounds of the English language. We do 
extensive analyses of the meaning of the texts in relation to their sound 
qualities (rhyme, rhythm, meter, alliteration, assonance, onomatopoeia, etc.).

After a successful passage of the course, the student will be able to analyze 
poetry and dramatic verse based on the sound qualities of the texts. The 
student will also be able to apply the analysis to the performance of the 
texts, thus deepening their understanding of the English literary language."
"PEACE, FREEDOM, JUSTICE: THE CULTURAL ETHOS OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL STATE ","This is a seminar on the political ethos of the West
and its main product: the democratic constitutional state. As a political 
ethos, democracy is based on a 
notion of common good that was developed throughout 
centuries of frequently troubled social and political processes, where trial, 
error and correction/adjustment played - and keeps playing - an important 
part. The seminar intends to highlight this dynamism and its cultural sources 
by examining it in the 
making. Its aim is to help you a) identify the core values that explain the 
political culture of western democracies; b) apply the resulting 
categories to gain a deeper insight into contemporary events, political 
trends and democracies in other parts of the world, employing - when relevant -
a comparative perspective. Some keywords are: ""civil society"", ""human 
rights"", ""crisis of democracy"", ""Confucianism"", ""democracy as procedure vs 
democracy as a values system"", ""ideology"", ""natural law"", ""political culture"""
SENIOR THESIS WRITING ,
경제학설사개설(2) ,"경제학 이론의 계보와 역사적 배경, 사상사적 맥락에 대해 이해한다."
SENIOR RESEARCH SEMINARS IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES ,"This course is designed for upper divesion (junior and senior) students, and is highly recommended for those interested developing a seminar paper for further graduate study. The course will require (1) critical reading of selected bibiography largely based on students` topics or interests, (2) present a research proposal, and (3) write a 15-20 page-long research paper.
During the first half of the semester, students come prepared each day for class discussions. Topics include East Asian international relations, Korean foreign and economic policy, and poliical economy of reigonal dynamics. During the second half of the course, students will identify their own research topic and produce a bibliography of related secondary readings. The class will devote several weeks to reading and discussing the secondary literature selected by class participants and instructor. The paper will be guided by a highly interactive process of student-instructor discussion."
THE IDEA OF DEMOCRACY ,"This course provides a sweeping overview of democratic ideas around the world 
from ancient Greece into the present day.   Readings will include a wide array 
of classical, modern and contemporary philosophers and activists."
INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY ,"This is an introductory course in statistical methods for political science students.

This syllabus preview is subject to change."
FOREIGN POLICY IN THEORY AND PRACTICE ,"This class aims to analyze how states formulate and implement its foreign policies. As a subfield of political science and international relations, Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA) illuminates the complex dynamics in many countries’ foreign policy-making and the issue of collective action in the anarchical international society. The course will nurture students’ analytical skills that will be applied to many public policy issues, not merely injecting substantive pieces of knowledge on foreign policy. Reflecting the analytical process and learning curve, this course roughly divides into three parts: theory and process of foreign policy, issues of global diplomacy, and comparative analysis of major countries’ foreign policies."
MEDIA AND CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN POLITICS ,"This course examines the role of mass media in American politics. As another significant political institution, mass media now boasts its impact on setting political/social agenda, framing issues and shaping public opinions. The course consist of three big themes: (1) development of mass media in American politics, (2) the roles of mass media in politics, and (3) interesting topics dealt with in media. Although it is recommended for students to have taken intro-American politics course, there is no prerequisite for this course."
NON-TRADITIONAL SECURITY STUDIES ,
POLITICS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INFORMATION SOCIETY ,"The subtitle for this class is `understanding political numbers.` This course will teach you how to understand quantitative analysis, how to develop a data-based research question that you can answer, how to collect and analyze the data, and how to present your conclusions to others. There are two components to the course: theoretical and technical. The theoretical part deals with questions like: why are numbers and data important to political analysis? What is the proper way to ask a research question? How do we find and use political data to tell a story and support an argument? In the technical part we learn how to employ one of the most commonly used statistical computing and graphics software R to clearly present our data and findings to others. Yet, this course is about more than just numbers. It is a skills and tools course. It is about learning how to ask and answer the right questions about politics. And, it is about employing the computing tools to help get to this end goal."
MORAL REASONING AND CRITICAL JUDGMENT ,"This course is designed to introduce the basic concepts and problems of moral reasoning and critical judgment. 
In everyday life, human beings must encounter differing opinions that try to argue their own truths about the good or bad way of life. 
But in the contemporary age of value-pluralism and liberal democratic culture, we tend to overlook the moral problems as simply private issues, 
often judging that there is no righteous ground of our being in the polis. But to coexist in a proper way, 
the human beings must confront the ethical questions of everyday living with others and the political necessity to resolve them. 
Reading the classical texts of great thinkers, we will try to think about the questionable nature of our moral problems 
and the best-possible ground to deal with them."
PRACTICE ON INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION ,"The objective of this course is to provide students with an introduction to the theoretical and practical aspects of negotiation. As negotiation is a
collaborative effort of analytical and interpersonal skills, conceptual frameworks will be introduced to assist in the analysis and effective
preparation of negotiations. Thus, this class will address:
?	Negotiation Fundamentals
?	Negotiation Sub-processes
?	Context of Negotiation
?	Overcoming Individual Differences
?	Intercultural Negotiations
?	Resolution of Differences
Furthermore, the application of concepts and tactics will be provided for through analysis of case studies and discussion of the readings. Students 
will also be able to experiment with different negotiation tactics and strategies, their powers of persuasion and communication through negotiation 
exercises."
CIVIL SOCIETY AND NGO ,"The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the academic understanding of civil society and non-governmental activism today. A special attention is given to the civil society development in Korea. The course is designed to address the needs and interests of students who intend to engage in diverse discussions and debates concerning the development of civil society and democracy.

The course both exposes and challenges students to investigate the complexities of civil society formation and its relationship to democratization. Active discussions are conducted on their reading and exposure. Particular civil society formations in Korea is examined through a categorization of legitimate, controlled, and repressed civil societies, differing by their relationship to the state.

The class is conducted in a participatory mode and differing views are encouraged. Critical thinking developed in this course will be useful both to the practitioners and more scholarly oriented students.

A list of topics will be given from which each student will write to submit an essay paper by the end of the semester. Essay papers will be assessed and marked according to the demonstrated competence of the subject, proper composition, reading, and critical analysis. Guidelines and advice for writing essay paper and in-class presentation will be provided. Each week, lecture outline will be handed out in class. Further reading materials other than in the following list, will be put into the Lecturer’s Reading Pack and made available for students."
CONTRACT LAW AND THE CISG ,"This course provides an introduction to the basic information relating to the contract laws around the world. For such goal, we will focus our review on one of the most very widely accepted international treaties regarding the contract law, namely, the United Nations Convention on the Contract for the International Sale of Goods(the “CISG”). By reviewing the CISG and sometimes comparing it with domestic laws and other international instruments regarding contracts, we will be able to understand the basic structure of the contract laws with some international perspectives."
ANALYTICS FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION ,"This course introduces analytical tools for social innovation. In addition to statistical methodologies for machine learning tools, which are currently in the spot light, we will introduce Tensorflow, which is being developed by google. These will be key tools in the analytical domain of, for instances, finding fake news and/or identifying spam emails. No prior knowledge of statistics or computer programming are required."
SOCIAL INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE DATA I ,"The goal of the course is to understand the concept of information privacy and think about the ways to protect information privacy in the context of health big data. The course will first cover fundamental concepts of information privacy. The course will then review the nature of big data, focusing on the values and risks of health big data. The course will then proceed to review the best policy options to create a balance between maximizing the values and minimizing the risks of using health big data. The course will review the cases of other countries and subsequently go over the specific issues raised in the Korean context."
BIG DATA AND PRIVACY ,"The goal of the course is to understand the concept of information privacy and think about the ways to protect information privacy in the context of health big data. The course will first cover fundamental concepts of information privacy. The course will then review the nature of big data, focusing on the values and risks of health big data. The course will then proceed to review the best policy options to create a balance between maximizing the values and minimizing the risks of using health big data. The course will review the cases of other countries and subsequently go over the specific issues raised in the Korean context."
과학기술과미래사회 ,"우리가 살아가는 세상은 과학기술과 떼려야 뗄 수 없는 밀접한 관계를 가지고 있습니다. 이 과목에서는 과학기술학(Science and Technology Studies)의 성과에 기반을 두고, 과학기술과 사회가 어떻게 상호 작용하고, 그 결과 미래 사회가 어떤 식으로 전개될지를 살펴봅니다.

특히 이 강의는 과학기술에 대한 ‘비판적’ 접근에 초점을 맞춥니다. 과학기술에 대한 ‘비판적’ 접근은 과학기술의 부정적인 점만을 부각하는 것이 아닙니다. 좋은 문학 비평, 영화 비평이 그렇듯이, 우리는 이런 ‘비판적’ 접근을 통해서 과학기술의 긍정적인 면과 부정적인 면을 판단하는 능력을 향상시킬 수 있습니다.

이 강의는 또 서로에 대한 이해가 부족한 이공계 학생과 인문사회계 학생 간의 상호 이해와 소통의 계기를 마련합니다."

Students will learn about the past and current strategies of various international organizations and the logic of the donors and the rationale for external assistance (e.g. UN, World Bank, NGOs, government agencies). Discussions will involve debates about the issues in sustainable development to understand how different theories about development influence policy, agenda, and programs implemented at different scales, international, national and local."
PUBLIC HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ,
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN FOOD SYSTEMS: PROMISE AND PERIL ,"Over the past 150 years, food systems have been transformed by developments in technology, science, and policy. At the same time that these changes have improved the human condition, they have also created new challenges. For instance, new technologies in farming equipment and synthetic fertilizers vastly increased the per-acre output of farms, but also contributed to the collapse of rural communities and the eutryphication of water ways. This class examines how the relationship between society and food has affected and been affected by the intertwined forces of industrialization, urbanization, and globalization. We will interrogate positions that the industrial food system is `inevitable` or `indispensible` to feeding a global population of 9 billion. This class will explore how technology and policy has helped bring about societies in which high levels of obesity, food insecurity, and food waste coexist. Students will examine critical case studies (e.g. GMOs, biofuels) to learn how these challenges are understood as policy problems and how science and technology are mobilized to address these problems. 

Final Paper Project description:
Students will also have a brief introduction to conducting one-on-one interviews to prepare them for their oral histories food systems project. 
For the oral histories project, students will conduct oral history interviews with elder(s) of their choice. This could be your parents, an aunt or uncle, grandparents, a friend of the family, or an acquaintance; though you should interview someone your parents` age or older to learn about their experiences with and recollections of food systems."

INFORMATION AND PERCEPTION ,"In the recent decade, we are bombarded with enormous amounts of dense information in our daily lives. In fact, many of us have so accustomed to the 
abundance of information that we expect and need it to be accessible virtually anywhere and anytime. Technological advancements, which seem to develop at lightning speed, continuously provide us with tools that make it easy for us to access information quickly. However, little is being done to aid people’s understanding of information that is increasing in complexity. In this class, we will discuss and study how our perception of information, interaction with others, believe systems, and even mental and physical well being can be affected. Although we can represent information various ways we should be asking how should it be designed to aid people’s understanding of it. 

The objective of this course is to help students:
- investigate the relationship between information, interaction, and perception. 
- explore processes and ideas for understanding information
- study and use the affordances of various mediums
- study the appropriateness of representations relative to audiences/contexts
- explore ways of making information representations accessible, logical, understandable, and enjoyable by inciting and facilitating interaction
- explore ways of representing information that enable customization, expansion, and participation"

AS LHP: SELECTED TOPICS IN CHINESE THOUGHT (2) ,"A general survey of Chinese thought from the earliest period to the 20th 
century, including I Ching, Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism and modernity 
issues during the May Fourth period."
AS LHP: TRANSNATIONAL SEXUALITY ACROSS ASIA ,"While globalization commonly refers to the disjuncture and intensification of connections among people, goods, images, capital, and information technology since the late 20th century onward, transnationalism as a critical framework is often deployed by both the benefactors and critics of global corporate capitalism. Hence, transnationalism gains saliency as a theoretical model across the social science and humanities precisely given its analytical ambition and scalar flexibility. Likewise, sexuality, like transnationalism, is said to be mobile, flexible, and even resistant to structural limits of the nation state. Like global capitalism, sexuality in its hetero, homo, queer, and other variant forms travel through institutions and regimes of capitalism, financialization, visual optics, and bodily commodification. In addition, since the wave of economic and sexual liberalizations in certain parts of Asia, transnational sexuality might be gaining traction not only as an analytical model in queer theory and area studies but increasingly in debates regarding anti-trafficking campaigns, human rights as LGBT rights, and the flows of migrant labors across the transpacific circuits. This advanced level course provides an introduction to psychoanalytic, poststructuralist, and Marxist theories of gender and sexuality in the early parts and then situate these theoretical concerns through methodological query on what constitutes “Asia,” “queerness,” “sexuality,” “gender,” “comparison,” “scale,” and etc. At the end of the course, students can be expected to acquire familiarity with texts from queer cultural expressions in other countries while thinking creatively to expand our received notions of queer theory and cultural politics."
TRANSNATIONAL ASIA ,"This course examines the social, political and cultural dimensions of 
transnational migration and momentous changes in Asian cities driven by 
transnational flows of people. Drawing upon theoretical approaches as well as 
ethnographic work, this interdisciplinary course encourages students to 1) 
develop a conceptual understanding of transnational migration and urban space, 
2) understand the issues emerging from particular migration regimes and their 
relations with migrant experiences in Asia, and, 3) critically analyse 
migration processes and space produced by migrants in Asian cities. Students 
are required to do mini-ethnographical studies focused on transnational space 
and write an ethnographically based paper. 

The course is divided into three parts. We begin by exploring the theoretical 
discussion in recent literature on “transnationalism,” “transnational 
migration in Asia,” and “migrants and urban space.” We move on to discuss 
case studies of specific transnational migrants and their place-making 
practices in urban space. Finally, we examine your mini-ethnographical studies 
on transnational space in Korea based on those common threads from our 
theoretical discussions, and shared analysis of case studies in Asian cities."

HISTORY OF CHINA: PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION ,"The Roots of Chinese Religion: Daoism, Confucianism, and Weather Control:

the end of this course, students will be familiar with the major developments in mainstream Chinese religion, including the emergence of ancestor veneration, the introduction of official cults centered on the government, the formation of institutional Daoism, and religious forms of “Confucianism.” In this course we explore the history of religion as a window into diverse aspects of culture and society. As one might expect, we will find out much regarding the understandings of human life, death, and the universe that have been held in China and how these evolved over time. More than this, however, focusing on religious activity gives us insight into all other aspects of human life, from politics and economics to gender and class relations."
HISTORY AND MEMORY IN EAST ASIA ,see the attached syllabus
MODERN GERMAN PHILOSOPHY ,"Up until the twentieth century, when Germany became known for more sinister 
things, it was known, perhaps above all, as the “Land of Thinkers and 
Poets.” Indeed: while Germany remained economically and politically something 
of a backwater throughout much of modern European history, it was also home to 
some of the most revolutionary and exciting philosophical revolutions of the 
last 250 years. Indeed; it is not only impossible to imagine what philosophy 
would look like without the revolution initiated by Kant in the quiet city of 
Königsberg, but it is also impossible to imagine what the world would look 
like: Marxism, Modernism and Post-Modernism, Fascism and Neo-Liberalism are 
all, in different ways, the intellectual children of German philosophy. And 
thus one can say without qualification: if we do not have some understanding 
of German philosophy, we cannot hope to understand the world in which we live.
The aim of this course is to provide students with a survey of some of the 
major texts of the German philosophical tradition. These texts cover a diverse 
range of topics, including epistemology, aesthetics, the philosophy of 
history, and political philosophy and economics. This course should thus also 
serve as a historical introduction to the “Continental” tradition of 
philosophy."
SHINHAN SEMINAR ,"PLEASE BE AWARE, to complete this class you MUST attend the special evening lectures with the visiting Shinhan Professor during the weeks of April 13-26.

Logic is often defined as the science of good reasoning. It is said to be intimately connected with our ability to think, express ourselves, understanding others, and attain knowledge of how the world works. In this class, we are going to examine the relationships between logic, truth, and paradox. We will tackle questions like: How does logic relate to good reasoning? Do sentences have ’logical forms’ and is this somehow built in to language? What is truth and what does it have to do with logical validity? Can we solve paradoxes by a judicious use of logic? What does it mean to revise a logical theory? Our goal is not to answer these questions once and for all, it is simply to have interesting discussions about these issues with a leading expert in the field of logic, Professor Jc Beall of the University of Connecticut."

ADVANCED CREATIVE WRITING: NARRATIVE COMPOSITION ,Anyone interested in learning about narrative theory in fiction and poetry.
MARXISM AND MODERNITY ,"Long before postcolonial theory arose as a field in the late 1970s, Marxian theory and philosophy has provided a framework for the critical analysis of imperialism, colonialism, nationalism, the subaltern, hegemony, mediation and the uneven capitalist world system?as part of its systemic critique of capital and capitalism. Moreover, many of the most trenchant works in postcolonial theory evince intimate engagements with Marxism, such as those by Frantz Fanon, Amilcar Cabral, Stuart Hall, Enrique Dussel, Samir Amin, Arif Dirlik, Gayatri Spivak and the subaltern studies group. This course posits that the analytical approaches and historical studies of postcolonial theory are most effective in examining the complex and contradictory conditions of modern societies, coeval modernities, and peripheral modernisms, as much as their historical origins and colonial/imperial lineages?when combined with a close engagement with the more capacious and rigorous mode of analysis provided by Marxism. 
Towards this end, we will begin with a survey of key concepts in the work of Marx and Engels?alienation, historical and dialectical materialism and Marx’s economic theory?followed by the work of leading Marxian thinkers of the 20th century: Lenin, Luxemburg, Gramsci, Lukacs, and Althusser, Williams, Eagleton, etc. Building upon this foundation, Part II moves on to examine Marxist theories of modernity and aesthetics from the critical theorists of the Frankfurt School, Marshall Berman, the Prolekult movement and Henri Lefebvre. And lastly, Part III examines key issues and contributions towards Marxist postcolonial studies through the work of thinkers who have taken both Marxist and postcolonial theory beyond traditionally circumscribed limits to tackle contemporary forces and structures of contemporary globalization."
THE SOCIOLOGY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE ,"Ever wondered who first wrote the Bible? Or in this regard, you might also wish to know how the Bible came into being as we have it right now. 
That is the first topic to be dealt with. The search for the answer requires a sophisticated cooperation from various modern disciplines; sociology, 
archeology, political science, and theology (knowledge and perception of God) as well to name a few. The primary goal of this seminar is to explore
 who wrote the Bible and when it was at first written. Rest assured that this rational question should not necessarily contradict the conventional 
wisdom or belief, rather it would shed more light on it. Associated with the above inquiry, it will also touch upon the concept 
of `Christ (Messiah); it is a corollary topic derived from the research. One of the most popular concepts 
in both Christianity and Judaism, it has yet been properly asked about. 
what it is and why Jesus, the founder of Christianity, had to be called 
by this title, or to be rejected by Judaism.
  The last topic to be addressed is the name of God, Yahweh or Jehovah in the 
Bible. According to the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible), the God of Israel was 
addressed as a personal name YHWH. How did the patron god of a nomadic family 
during the Iron Age eventually come to dominate the rivaling pantheons, giving 
birth to a modern day monotheism? You will be introduced to the first 
appearance of the name YHWH in historical, real texts."
PHILOSOPHY OF RACE AND GENDER ,"Race and gender are central to our lives. This upper-level writing seminar 
explores how race and gender might be viewed through the lenses of philosophy 
and science, with an emphasis on what recent psychology can tell us about our 
own, perhaps unconscious attitudes towards race and gender. In the first part 
of this course, we will examine the extent to which race and gender are useful 
scientific categories. Do they correlate with general biological or cognitive 
differences, such as medical conditions, IQ, aggression or mathematical 
ability? Thus we will seek to address the extent to which race and gender are 
social constructions, objective natural categories, or ought to be eliminated 
from scientific discourse. In the second half of the course we will examine 
the recent explosion of research on implicit, unconscious attitudes about race 
and gender. One of the most provocative findings by psychologists is that 
negative implicit attitudes often persist even when explicit attitudes on race 
or gender are positive, and oriented towards equality. In light of this, each 
student (and the professor!) will be asked to take a personal journey and test 
herself (confidentially) on implicit biases related to gender and race. We 
will then explore the implications of these findings —on hiring, voting, 
juries, your professor’s grading!— and explore psychology’s most recent 
recommendations on ameliorating negative implicit/unconscious attitudes on 
race and gender."
SHINHAN VISITING FACULTY SEMINAR ,helenlee@yonsei.ac.kr (course coordinator)
MODERNISM/MODERNITY ,"""Il faut etre de son temps"" -- one must be of one`s time, Daumier famously declares, lending voice to the militant artistic movements in the mid-nineteenth century that sought to throw off establishment politics by taking on new subject matter in new ways. What does it take to be relevant, to come to grips with contemporary reality, or to deal with the stuff of modern life at large (e.g. hordes of other bodies crowding the city, a surfeit of commodities on display, endless bureaucracy, sexual performance and repression, technological innovation, and of course, violence of an unprecedented scale)? What strategies do writers use to smuggle critique into their work, and to what ends?

This course examines a wide array of texts from radical social theories to experimental poetry and prose to avant-garde screeds-- key works that compose the conceptual apparatus we have come to call ""modernism.""  The course is intensive; the readings are immensely rewarding but also challenging in theme and style.  We will devote a good amount of time discussing and reading closely. You will be asked to present to the class at least once during semester and to write two essays that demonstrate close-reading and argumentation skills."
ENGLISH RENAISSANCE LITERATURE ,"This course surveys playwrights (and poets) in the English Renaissance. We will study, of course, such a colossal figure as Shakespeare, but we will study authors whose names have been eclipsed by Shakespeare such as Marlowe, Kyd, Webster, and Spenser. This era witnessed the rise of English theatre as a secular and commercial form, and the advent of theatre is coterminous with cultural transformations affecting people’s changed understandings of religion, social classes, and nation state. The rise of print-capitalism and the discovery of new worlds in this period radically changed people’s philosophy and culture. This course, in this light, will examine the relationship between early modern literature and society mainly through the lens of the early modern dramas (and poetry) produced in response to these changes. The issues to be explored over the semester will extensively include (not be limited to) the rise of commercial theatre in London, class mobility and gender construction in this period, the rise of early modern colonialism, and revenge tragedies as a new cultural form, and the advent of print capitalism and the nation formation."
MYTH AND COUNTER-CULTURE ,"We will read closely and analyze particular aspects of myths that lie at the 
cores of establishments which engender fringe-, sub-, and counter-cultures 
through various manifestations of dissent, resistance and protest. In 
reviewing specific texts that arise out of such oppositions, we will engage 
the following question: to what extent do certain critiques of dominant 
pedagogical, financial, scientific, medical (allopathic), artistic and 
spiritual institutions offer viable alternatives to mainstreams? While we will 
touch upon theories of deviance, labeling, criminality, pathology and 
conspiracy, our main focus will be on actively researching, discussing and 
practicing means to effect positive cultural, social and personal change with 
the ultimate goal of individual and societal well-being."
국제무역론 ,"This course covers the study of comprehensive theories of internatonal trade to understand the basis for and the gains from trade. In particular, the course studies the classical models of Ricardo and Heckscher-Ohlin, and the new trade models based on imperfect competition with increasing returns to scale. Based on the sound understanding of the trade theories, the course also explores the effects of trade protectionism on the nation`s welfare and other political economy of trade policy/practice areas of interest and controversies."
HUMAN RIGHTS: ISSUES AND PROBLEMS ,"This course looks at the international human rights regime, discusses the 
origins of the so-called human rights revolution after WWII and looks at 
current human rights problems in the world. It encourages students to 
understand what human rights are and how to practically understand basic human 
rights provisions in the human rights treaties; the work of the UN bodies and 
mechanisms; and advocacy work of NGOs using human rights law and UN bodies. 
Students should be equipped to analyze and discuss various new human rights 
problems and issues that are on the rise with for example foreign investments 
and environmental changes, or non-state armed groups, as well as to look at the 
historical aspects of human rights problems and connect them with recent, but 
not so new issues, such as refugee crises, or crimes against humanity that 
affect us at present times. The students will be offered opportunities to 
understand the limitation of states’ responses to grave human rights 
violations and the importance of the transnational human rights network to 
place important human rights issues on the agenda of states. Students should be 
able to discuss different views and justify their arguments for or against 
action in the name of human rights."
PROJECT DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ,"This course offers a basic understanding of key concepts and principles essential to effective project design and management in international development cooperation. It examines the inner workings of projects in the process of planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation with an emphasis on the Official Development Assistance (ODA) projects.  Current issues of ODA, theories of the nature of participation, and the mechanics and measurement of social change are discussed to provide context for the practical skills that form the core of the course. 

Upon completion of the course, students are expected to:
?	Understand the life cycle of international development cooperation projects 
?	Employ and analyze the processes, methods, and tools that are used in the planning, management, and evaluation of development projects in the professional practice
?	Formulate a basic development project proposal 
?	Evaluate project proposals based on key concepts and principles used in the professional practice"
MODERN CHINA-KOREA RELATIONS ,"This course explores intersection points between China and Korea during modern 
times, picking up in the Ming-Qing/ Choson period and coming into the present. 
We study official relations between Beijing and Seoul/ Pyongyang, but also 
look more broadly at connections, both continuities and divergences, between 
their experiences of modernity. The focus is on politics and ideas, war and 
foreign relations, but diversions are made into social and economic themes 
from time to time.
Three massive wars functions as the “violent teacher” for understanding the 
evolution of Sino-Korean relations—the Imjin War of the 1590s, Sino-Japanese 
War of the 1890s, and Korean War of the 1950s. The parallel evolution of 
Confucian monarchical states into a variety of communist, democratic, and 
developmental states is another major topic of the course. We also examine the 
varieties of East Asian nationalism by comparing the self-strengthening, 
patriotic enlightenment (the March 1st and May 4th), pan-Asianist, and 
communist movements. We trace the development of Sino-Korean relations into 
the contemporary period, from the violence of the Korean War to the diplomacy 
of the Six Party Talks, and Beijing’s post-Cold War strategy of being friends 
with both Koreas.
Each week’s reading combines classic and cutting-edge scholarship along with 
primary sources in English translation. Students with Chinese 
and Korean language skills are encouraged to look at original materials, but 
there is no language requirement in order to fulfill the requirements of the 
course."

정치학데이터분석 ,"This course aims to provide you with a general road map of the scientific study of political inquiry. To that end, I have the following main goals in this course. First, we will focus on establishing the central role of causal explanation in political science. It is important to understand that any substantive research, whether it uses quantitative or qualitative analysis, remains incomplete unless it is grounded in a sound theoretical understanding of causation and other related concepts. Second, while there are different research models and approaches, we will concentrate on one of them: statistical explanation. We will study how to do original statistical research using, for example, cross tabulation or linear regression and how to understand and critique the empirical work done by other political scientists. Note: We will not have separate lab sessions but the course involves the intensive use of statistical software such as STATA or R. *** NO ELECTRONIC DEVICES are allowed in class unless otherwise directed by me."
BUSINESS ETHICS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ,"-This course is designed to provide a fundamental understanding of business ethics and social responsibility. 

-The first part of the course provides the basic concepts of ethics. 
-Then we apply these conceptual tools and frameworks to a variety of business settings (e.g., Google, Walmart, Apple, etc). 
-We also discuss social responsibility, such as Starbuck`s social responsibility and brand strength."
INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT AND TORT LAW ,"Contract law governs relationships that we deliberately enter into via a process of negotiation, offer, and acceptance, while tort law governs the relationships that we all share with each other simply by virtue of our participation in the same society.

In this course, we will explore both the law itself as well as the relationship between law and society. We will start by exploring the settled, black letter principles of the law--what the law actually says. Using those principles, we will get some practice at doing legal analysis--applying the law to hypothetical disputes. This will give students a sense of the laws that govern our daily lives, and some experience of what a traditional legal education is like. Then we will move into discussing the policy issues behind the law, and whether the law as it currently exists is effective for promoting human flourishing--which is (or at least should be) the ultimate goal of all our laws. Finally, we will consider how our relationships that are governed by law compare to those that are not, and what we can learn (in both directions, and both good and bad) from that comparison.

Target knowledge and skills to be developed:

- Introductory knowledge of tort and contract law
- Understanding of the relationship between law and society
- Basic legal and policy analysis
- Critical thinking and debate skills
- Clear and effective persuasive writing"
CURRENT TOPICS IN WORLD ECONOMICS ,"-This course is a survey course covering hot and pressing topics in current global economics, discussing implications for law and public policy. 
-A tentative schedule of topics is found below, including Bitcoin (Blockchain), Sharing Economy (Google, Facebook, Amazon.etc), and Intellectual Property.
-We will go over these topics from the perspectives of consumers (investors), firms, and society, discussing legal and policy implications. 
-We might narrow them down or include more topics, as time allows or under time constraints. 
-The reading materials to be covered in class are straightforward and easy to understand. 
-You are “NOT” expected to get full grips on the topics, as they are ongoing issues."
FINANCIAL DATA ANALYSIS ,"The aim of the course is to provide students with the necessary toolkit to 
analyze and extract information from financial data. In this course, we 
introduce fundamentals of financial investments and basic econometric methods 
applied to financial data. This course weighs equally on both theoretical and 
practical learning with the following goals: (1) familiarizing students with 
the features of financial data, (2) equipping students with investment theory 
to analyze the financial data, and (3) enabling students to implement the 
techniques for financial investment using computer software."

WOMEN IN THE CLASSICAL AGE OF ISLAM ,"Depictions of women have played an important role in constructing Western stereotypes about Islam. The harem, veiling, and polygyny have all played a critical part in shaping contemporary attitudes towards Islam at the start of the twenty-first century. This course will work to place these practices within a historical framework, transcending some of 
the stigmas surrounding issues of gender and sexuality in Islam to highlight the critical role played by women in the formation of Islamic political, social, and cultural history. 
By focussing on the ‘Classical Age of Islam’ (circa 600-1000CE), this course will demonstrate the important contribution of women to the formation of an Islamic Civilization. 

This course is intended to advance the students’ understanding of global processes, to improve their ability to conduct independent research, to read both primary sources and 
modern sources critically, and to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills in a historical context. Having completed this course students will be able to:
-	Demonstrate an understanding of key themes in the study of Islamic and Middle Eastern history.
-	Analyse and explicate major ideas associated with the history of the Islamic world.
-	Explain relationships between intellectual developments of the Islamic world and broader issues of historical context.
-	Use period sources to reconstruct attitudes, beliefs and arguments from the past.
-	Construct evidence-based arguments about the legacy of important events in Islamic history."

Each student will design and build a tool product prototype as a final result of this course. In addition to the basic product design process training, this course will also be a chance to think about the utilitarian, aesthetic and semantic aspects of product design."
AS LHP: TRANSNATIONAL FEMINISM IN ASIA ,"Feminism refers to the philosophy, ideology, and socio-political practices that women, men, and social subjects participate in, with the goal of redefining existing structures of hetero-patriarchal dominations and inequality. In this class, we will push some of the following questions to their theoretical limits: in what ways is biological notion of sex really distinct from a conventional notion of gender as a socially ascribed category? How does a poststructuralist account of sex and gender challenge the biological essentialism of sex itself? How are feminist struggles across East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia parallel and comparable to each other in their shared political aspirations? How does war and militarism in fact mobilize and depend on sexual labour that demands a transnational analysis attentive to the hegemony of empire and colonialism? Finally, how might we locate and imagine transnational politics of feminism in this post-Cold War yet continual militarized present in Asia? The aim of this course is twofold: to introduce feminism as a powerful analytical lens to read history, literature, theory, and real lives rather than simply another marginalized sub-discipline of social theory; secondly, we will study Asian forms of feminism in its historicity, theory, and political aspirations. Students are not expected to have background knowledge in feminist theory. An open mind and rigorous engagement with the readings are expected and required."
"HONG KONG CINEMA: TIME, SPACE AND IDENTITY ","This course introduces students to the rich history of Hong Kong cinema through the focus of time, space, and identity. Hong Kong cinema participates in the transnational arena of filmmaking from the start?the first Hong Kong film is often attributed to Lai Man-wai’s 1913’s Zhuangzi Tests His Wife. Lai, the “father of Hong Kong cinema,” was himself born in Japan, participated in Sun Yat-sen’s revolutionary activities, and contributed to the flowering of Shanghai cinema in the 1920s. From this brief introduction, the course will trace the emergence of Hong Kong cinema within the contexts of the split of the two Chinas, post-war Hong Kong, the arrival of sound cinema and the studios divergence between Cantonese and Mandarin-language films, Bruce Lee, King Hu, and their heterogeneous martial art films, to the more contemporary films of the Hong Kong New Wave and post-SAR cinema. In addition to providing a historical study of Hong Kong cinema, the course will also focalize on representations of desire and sentiment, postcolonialism, migration, feminism, queer desire, and border-crossing. The class will conclude with discussion on the promise and peril of China-Hong Kong co-production and how Sinophone cinema and new localism might provide new imaginaries to cope with the increasing commercial decline of Hong Kong cinema in the age of the rise of China."
MEDIA ART PRODUCTION ,"This course is designed to help the students understand the context of `media + art` production in Korean society particularly in recent history. We will study the capacity and the possibility of media art production, as a media practice and a part of art works in a society through the semester. The class pays attention to ethnographic practice among various art practices which has been growing rapidly in diverse areas, and the value of ‘publicness’ in contemporary researches and art practices through each sections which include the arguements in contemporary art, anthropology and information science.  
 Main contents of the class will include (1) the legacy of ‘media art’ in Korean society, its historical flow and uniqueness (2) production of ethnographic contents using the effective media 3) searching for the vision in our society.  Class will be composed of three sections; lecture, discussion, and studio. Challenges and shares are encouraged most."

Students are introduced to a number of major theoretical paradigms in cultural studies and media studies. They are encouraged to apply to aspects of popular culture in East Asia, with a slight emphasis on Korea overall. 

In this course students will learn about different viewpoints regarding a variety of cultural discourses and issues. In doing so, students will also learn how to build their perspectives or arguments on many cultural issues on popular culture. Students will read and discuss about materials on a variety of issues including digital media (including Internet, social media), globalization, fandom, multiculturalism, cultural identity, and so on. 

By the end of the course, the successful learner will have gained:

-  an understanding of the defining characteristics of popular cultures and media in Asia.
-  experience in discussing popular practical and theoretical paradigms that apply in cultural studies and media studies.
-  learned how to examine the historical, social and cultural environments that produce popular cultural products and use this knowledge to develop their critical thinking and analytic skills.
-  experience in presenting their ideas and defending their position."
CRITICAL ISSUES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA ,"The class aims to provide the introduction of extremely various area, SouthEast Asia whoes people, 
cultures are very different from one another. Starting from brief history of SEA countries, the course will 
explore contemporary issues such as ethnic and religious conflicts, 
migration, poverty, development and environmental justice, and so on."
THEORY AND PRACTICE FOR CONTEMPORARY KOREA ,"Organized like an upper division seminar, this course examines questions of belonging and exclusion in contemporary South Korean society, politics, and culture. We begin with three theoretical texts that will serve as comparative, political, and philosophical points of reference: Mary Beard’s Women & Power, Alain Badiou’s Ethics, and Wendy Brown’s Regulating Aversion. We then turn to specific topics: beauty, feminisms, and geopolitics; the system of gender and sexuality (with a quick look, for historical comparison, at male concubinage in late 19th century Chos?n); intercountry adoption in the time of empire; race/ethnicity, class, and transborder membership; and national security, conscientious objection, and peace activism. In the final part of the course, with instructor supervision and constructive feedback from peers, each student will pursue his or her own research project."
DIGITAL SOCIAL MEDIA ,"People are getting used to communicate and build relationships through new communication 
channels, so called digital social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. 
Digital social media is rapidly becoming daily activities of many people’s life. Among latest new 
phenomena, digital social media are the one that shows tremendous impacts in today’s society

HISTORY OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY ,"In this course we will explore the development of the modern scientific 
worldview through the major intellectual revolutions that have shaped it. We 
will begin with the Copernican Revolution in astronomy, along with the broader 
set of intellectual upheavals of which it was part, the so-called “Scientific 
Revolution”. We will then explore another startling revolution, the 
Darwinian, and the provocative movement that grew up around this. 
Amongst other things, we will explore the impact of Darwin’s ideas in 
Victorian England and why these led to the confrontation between 
science and religion that, in some quarters, persists to this day.  Finally, we will view Einstein’s revolutionary
impact on physicists’ conceptions of space and time. 

The overall aims of this historical exploration are to broaden your 
understanding of science."
INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF THE MIND ,"This course counts towards UIC’s scientific literacy requirement. It is essentially an introduction to cognitive science with a special emphasis in the latter half on how cognitive science bears on social issues such as intelligence, race, sex, religion and morality. The first part of the course focuses on models of the structure or architecture of the mind/brain. We will look at different “levels” of characterizing the mind/brain and different contributions made by different fields including linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, and psychology? toward characterizing the structure and nature of cognition. In particular, we will examine two competing and central architectural proposals: the mind as a physical symbol system and as a neural network. In the second part of the course, we will examine how contemporary cognitive science contributes to our understanding of sexual psychology, heritability and intelligence, religious cognition, as well as moral beliefs and racial stereotyping. Successful completion of this course will leave the student with an understanding of how cognitive scientists marshal evidence and arguments, from a variety of disciplines, for their preferred explanations of the mind/brain. Students will also leave the course with an understanding of how competing theories pertain to important social issues in the cognitive sciences, and that these areas of research are very active and potentially ground-breaking."
TOPICS IN FICTION ,"Topics in Fiction

This course will focus on the art and craft of writing fiction. Students will 
create original works of fiction that will be reviewed in small and large 
discussion groups. Literary topics of form, character, dialogue, plot, and 
other contemporary strategies will be at the forefront of our weekly meetings. 
Additional course texts will include novels and short-story collections from 
around the world. 

Topics in Fiction will focus on special topics and genres determined by members of the class. Possible genres will range from fantasy to conventional realism and avant-garde literature. 

After the first few weeks of literary analysis, we`ll begin to workshop student 
fiction. Members of this class will submit and receive feedback on at least two 
stories. All classes will be highly interactive, and members will experiment 
with new writing styles and gain insight from a group of diverse and thoughtful 
readers."
INTRODUCTION TO LAW ,"This course originated more than 5 years ago as Law and  Society: how law affects society and vice versa.  Now the course has developed more towards polemics dealing with conflicts within South Korea. 
As of now, Korea is amid most complex situation surrounding the nuclear development in North Korea posing as an existential threat to not only South Korea but also the U.S. and the rest of the world.  Security for Pyeongchang Olympic was barely assured by South Korea`s efforts towards the participation of North Korea.
The students will learn legal concepts through current events in Korea at the front lines of a changing society, politics and regional security.
Political consciousness of Korea will be raised through analysis of major events in Korea such as the Cheonan incident, mad cow propaganda, Taean oil spill, politization of sinking of Sewol, militant labor unions, etc.
In the first half of the course, the student is trained to read and interpret 
codified law as well as common law, and apply them to factual situations.  
The second half of the course will be oriented towards seminars by individual 
presentations and class participation on determining justice behind various 
legislations and policies."
INTRODUCTION TO MUSIC AND ITS MEANING ,"From the beginnings of human civilization, music has been an important part of 
life, playing a part in religious rituals and ceremonies, festivals and daily 
life, and accompanying human beings in times of peace and times of war. But 
why is it that music has such a power over the emotions, and how can we learn 
to talk about music and analyze what it is?
The aim of this course is to provide you with the tools to become intelligent 
listeners of music. After learning to recognize and describe formal elements 
of music, such as melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, timbre, musical form we 
will study the history of Western classical music, mainly from the Barogue 
period to the Romantic period.    
Listening exercizes and class participation will constitute an important part 
of instruction."
MUSIC IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ,"The Twentieth-Century represents one of the most exciting and wide-ranging 
chapters in musical history. Modernist classical composers like Arnold 
Schoenberg and John Cage radically challenged existing notions of what music 
is supposed to be and its esthetic meaning. This led to forms of western art 
music that were ever more experimental, diverse, and challenging: atonal 
music, serialism, neo-classicism, minimalism, multimedia and electronic 
compositions, and postmodernism.  Yet at the same time that “classical music”
(western art music) seemed to become more and more esoteric,  the drastic 
revolutions in the technology of recording and sound production led to the 
emergence of music as a global cultural phenomenon.

The goal of this course is to study both of these sides of music in the 
Twentieth-Century.  In the first half of the semester we will study the 
exciting developments in classical music in Europe and America that led from 
the late Romanticism of Wagner, Mahler and Strauss to 20th century 
impressionism, atonality, serialism, minimalism, neo classicism, avan-garde, 
and postmodernism.  We will also study the parallel develops of popular music 
in America from Blues, Jazz, Rock and roll to Hip-Pop and Rap. While the main 
focus of this course will be on understanding and appreciating the music 
itself from a musical perspective and recognizing the underlying structures 
and musical concepts, we will also consider historical background, and the 
importance of music as a crucial element of modern culture. And finally we 
will try to think about the role that music plays in creating a truly global 
society."
BIBLE AND LITERATURE ,"This course will deal with one of the two pillars of the western civilization; the Ancient Near East including  the Biblical(Hebraic) World! However, you will realize by the end of the semester that this ANE civilization and culture are none other than the first human accomplishment, which later on paved 
a way for the rise of Western Civilization. It will seek to introduce the history and literature of the ANE in relation with the Bible to the students; 
Egyptology, Hittitology, Assyriology, and if possible, Minoan civilization in ancient Greek in passing. 
The course will be operative with the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) in mind, as the Biblical narratives (such as creation story, prophecy, and 
historical books) are relatively well known to the intellectuals; the students would be able to compare the Biblical records (narratives, poems, prophecy, and historiography) with the corresponding ANE texts in academic terms by locating them within the world of the ANE.
The goal of the course is to give students a balanced view on the roots of western civilization; Hebraic (in the context of ANE) and Greek worlds.It is 
deemed timely as the world we know it is now struggling to solve potential conflicts between seemingly different civilizations, in particular, 
between Jewish/Christian and Islamic persuasions. The understanding of the common motives and roots of both the eastern and western civilizations
will contribute to a more harmonious development of human history.
Besides the ancient literature, you would be given an opportunity to learn some of the ancient languages necessary for the study, though 
on introductory levels.
You will be exposed to such a few semitic languages and pictorial signs as 
Classical Hebrew, Akkadian(cuneiform), and Hieroglyph (Ancient Egyptian)."
FICTION WORKSHOP: FROM SHORT STORY TO NOVEL ,"You will become familiar with the writing process, critique fiction in progress in a workshop environment, and work on writing exercises as well as a longer short story or novel chapter. The long-term goal is to develop regular writing habits and a writing schedule, and especially, to learn how to read as a writer."
APPROACHES TO WORLD CINEMA ,"This course offers an overview of the history and aesthetics of non-Western films. It explores how these films have responded to the social, economic, political and cultural transformations in the non-Western worlds such as Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East from the postcolonial era up to the present. Students will have opportunities to understand key non-Western film movements and filmmakers, as well as concepts, issues, and approaches relevant to non-Western cinemas. This course will give students a clear sense of the historical significance of non-Western films overlooked by Euro-American-centric film historiography."
INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION ,"This class provides an overview of communication between cultures from the 
perspective of communication.  The course emphasizes culture as a context for 
communication, provides an overview of communication variables affecting 
culture and barriers preventing communication among cultures.   
You will: 
- Develop understanding of the intercultural communication process 
- Enhance appreciation of the diverse ways of communicating in different cultures 
- Develop analytical skills in examining intercultural interactions 
- Increase understanding of cultural issues that influence communication 
effectiveness

Most of all, you will learn from each other and without a doubt you will learn 
about yourself."
ADVANCED CHINESE READING ,"In this course, the explanations of some grammatical concepts that are first introduced in Level 1 will be further expanded and explored in more detail. Some language structures that are similar to each other will be contrastively discussed.
There are four topics (four lessons) will be covered during one semester. After learning one lesson, a content-related article will be provided to students to improve students` reading and writing skills.  
In the class, some authentic materials will be used in order to increase students’ cultural competency and knowledge of Chinese society.   

Students who take this course are expected to achieve the following goals by the end of this semester. 
(1) 400 words and phrases will be taught.
(2) 50 grammar points and their usage will be achieved.
(3) Social conversational skills and fluency will be improved.
(4) Reading and Writing ability will be developed.
(4) Understanding of Chinese society will be deepened."
"SELF-LEADERSHIP,CREATIVE IDEAS AND SOCIAL ISSUES ","My original title for the course was `Monotheism in post modern world.` As indicated, the course aims to unearth the wisdom of Monotheism, in order to deal with post 9/11 world. The world we live in at the present age is marked by a new species of conflict unseen before; ideology has long been replaced by seemingly looming confrontation of so called civilizations (S. Huntington), and further widening gab of wealth among economic players, to name a few. There have been many courses dealing with the prevalent global issues, but  all too few about `how to deal with the underlying issues behind the scene; moral and spiritual ones. The real isssues are about philosophy, ethics, morals and spiritual aspects quintessentially. The course will attemt to initiate a conversation with  philosophical and moral foundations of modern day conflicting issues by inviting the conventional ideas drawn from wellspring of Biblical literature."
BUSINESS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ,"Course Outline

1)This course is designed to provide students with an overview of business/marketing in the global context.   

2)We also discuss the best online/offline practices for brands/customer relationships /distribution channels/advertising in Korea and Overseas.

3)As part of our curriculum, student groups apply in-class materials to develop their own startups by following the guidance provided by Yonsei Enterprise Support Foundation.  Students will have a hand-on experience of doing business in real world markets. Upon successfully completing this course, the CBL certificate (Community-based Learning Certificate) will be issued by Yonsei University to students. The certificate will be very useful in pursuing job or academic careers. 

4)By going through all the steps with their group members like Silicon Valley-style startup folks, students would get to a deeper understanding of business and social responsibility. 

5)There will be several guest speakers (from industry) and possibly group sessions on Thursdays (instead of Tuesdays). Students are expected to stay in class until 6:50 pm on Thursdays if required.      
If you have any questions about scheduling, please contact me at jsuh123@yonsei.ac.kr.

6) This class is also designated as a Social Innovation Certificate (SIC) course by Yonsei University. The course contents and practices will be related to social innovation and social problem solving. The Institute of Higher Education Innovation (IHEI) may collect and accumulate student assignments and course contents for further purpose. For more details regarding the SIC, please visit the IHEI`s website, http://ihei.yonsei.ac.kr."
LAW AND POLICY ,"This course is designed to give students an understanding of the philosophical and institutional ‘operating system’ of the United States. By learning about how the country is supposed to operate, we can better understand the processes by which the US government acts, including how ideas become policies and the structural limitations on the executive branch. This will give us a better understanding of how the US is able to act in international relations, and how domestic policies (e.g. trade or human rights) that can affect the rest of the world are shaped.
The course will be conducted collaboratively with universities in the United States, and students at Yonsei will interact with students from those universities in online discussions as part of their assessment."
GENRE STUDIES: READING AND WRITING GENRE FICTION ,"Genre Studies 

This course will focus on the art and craft of writing Genre Fiction. Mystery, 
Fantasy, Romance, Science Fiction, Horror, Inspirational, and 
other genres will be explored during weekly readings. Students will create 
original works of genre fiction that will be reviewed in small and large 
discussion groups. Literary topics of form, character, dialogue, and other 
contemporary strategies will be at the forefront of our weekly meetings. 
Special emphasis will be given to the investigation and construction of 
dramatic plot.

Additional course texts will map genre lines and introduce hybrid storytelling 
from around the world. After the first few weeks of literary analysis, we`ll 
begin to workshop student fiction. Members of this class will submit and 
receive feedback on at least two stories. All classes will be highly 
interactive, and members will experiment with new writing styles and gain 
insight from a group of diverse and thoughtful readers."
TOPICS IN FEMINISM ,"A Room of One`s Own  

This course is concerned with the interpenetrations of feminist thinking and literary style. Beginning with 
Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own and Three Guineas, we will consider such feminist figures as Simone 
de Beauvoir, Adrienne Rich, Julia Kristeva, and Judith Butler."
ART IN PREMODERN EAST ASIA ,"In this course, we will mainly study the cultural exchanges through art in East Asian region pertaining to the period between the 14th to 19th centuries. 
First of all, we will survey the art theory and issues of ceramics, Buddhist art and traditional paintings. Especially through researching concrete and representative art works of China and Korea, we can understand the cultural and historical meanings. 
And we`ll also deal with the cultural exchanges between Korea and her neighboring countries and make the design and plan for small special exhibitions on the basis of the analysis of art relics."
READINGS IN MEDIEVAL EUROPEAN LITERATURE ,
"PHILOSOPHY AS LITERATURE, PHILOSOPHY AS AUTOBIOGRAPHY ","The ultimate paradox of thought, writes Kierkegaard’s pseudonymous speaker Johannes Climacus, is “to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.” Thought thus calls upon language’s generative power to create a referent in its absence. 

Arguably since the days of Plato and Aristotle, literature and philosophy have been in dialogue and quarrel with each other. The pat division of disciplines in our era suggests that philosophy aspires to closure, to coherent systems and solutions, while literature seeks to disrupt and to keep intractable elements alive. Yet the boundaries of knowing and creating are rather fungible, constantly up for negotiation and conceived through the individuating mark of style.

For the writers featured in the course, the enterprise of philosophy is a deeply personal one, mediated through the jagged edges of the life lived, failed, and rediscovered in reflection. It requires the invention of genres such as the essay and the autobiography. It trades in the problems (and plays) of authorial voice, narrative representation, and readership. We will read philosophy as a form of literature, testing our interpretation or even aesthetic appreciation with and against the moral and ethical quandaries at stake."
MEDIEVAL CULTURE AND MODERN FILMS ,"Some films can be a gateway to history, legend, or myth in the past. But films as a fictive reality have their own agenda.
This course will approach medieval culture and society through the lens of films devoted to medieval period, 
but without sacrificing the latter`s autonomy for the former`s authenticity. So we can focus on the distance 
between medieval reality and fictive filmic performances, the roles of medieval male and female characters, 
and each film`s special cinematographic or meta-filmic elements. Students will be encouraged to discuss 
any topics that come to mind in the classroom. For the professor`s side, one of them will be about the reasoning methods 
to solve riddlesome criminal cases appearing in a portion of the given films."
EUROPEAN MODERNISM ,"This course will examine some major texts on European modernity together with postmodern challenge. The selections from the works of Hegel, Heidegger, Wittgenstein and others will be discussed with the critical lectures/discussion of the issues in phenomenology, epistemology and philosophy of art."
정치및공공경제 ,"In this class we will study how a government makes decisions and what decisions it should make. This leads us to a variety of interesting topics such as political processes, tax policies, and so on. For example, to enact a government policy, citizens must elect the party that will take charge of the government. A typical method of election is the majority voting, which begets interesting questions: when each citizen has a different preference from each other, what will be the outcome of the majority voting? Will the outcome be efficient? If not, how can we restore efficiency in electing the government? We will study these interesting topics in this class, using economic models."
MODERN ISRAEL AND THE MIDDLE EAST ,"History of Israel as a small and highly developed nation, which is laid in the most unstable and violent the Middle East surroundings, is unique and is worth to be discussed and analysed. Better knowledge of Israeli society, politics, and economy, its domestic and foreign policy might be taken and a key to eliminating and resolving current conflicts, or at the very least finding further solutions for stabilising of the whole region.
This course suggests the overview and analytical insight in the regional conflicts in their historical and modern perspectives with the special attention to the modern Israeli state and society."
TERRORISM AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ,"Security is the single most important concept in International Relations, but 
the way we think about it has changed greatly over time. This course will look 
at the different facets of security as the concept (and the world) has 
evolved. We will begin with traditional military security, and what might be 
called strategic studies, and follow the evolution of the idea to include 
newer and increasingly important concepts such as human and environmental 
security. By the end of the course, students will have a well-rounded 
understanding of the concept of security, and will be able to use it as a tool 
to investigate all aspects of international relations.
NB: Please excuse the title; this is not a course focused on terrorism, but for administrative reasons this course uses the title of an older course that was."
INTRODUCTION TO CYBERSECURITY ,"This course is designed to introduce students to the wide range of 
opportunities and threats that have opened up with the advent of the 
information age. Students will come to understand holistically how 
cybersecurity connects to a wide range of issue areas in international 
security (military, economic, social, etc), and how the digitization of 
information leads to new vulnerabilities that traditional Security Studies has 
never faced before. This will give students a head start when they inevitably 
have to deal with cyber-related issues throughout their careers."
THE TWO WORLD WARS ,"The world by the beginning of the 20th century became highly interdependent and intervisible in terms of production and consumption, building states and nations, forming new political systems and ideologies. Socio-political and economic development of some countries showed their uneven distribution and, hence, influence on the global scale. Anxieties among the more experienced players of losing the imperial race and the desire of newcomers to join the competition led to the horrific outbreaks of bloody conflicts and wars. Our course “The Two World Wars” tends to identify the underlying mechanisms of the global processes that led to the large-scale conflicts. We will also try to distinguish those ideas and ideologies that determined the subsequent actions of the great powers to spread their influence. The Great War and the Total War (World War I and World War II, respectively), as believed, were the last global conflicts that allowed us to produce gradual positive changes in international relationships and internal changes toward honoring the civil and human rights of every individual. This course, however, spends little time on describing military battles and operations, yet focuses on the change in international relations and foreign policy of major powers involved in the conflicts as well as the change in human behavior."
NEW ERA OF GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM ,"This course is intended to study and understand 
1) basic financial knowledge including IRR, duration, options, CAPM and etc., 
2) What you might have to do financial analysis,
3) what happened to the world during 2008 global financial turmoil, and 
4) How to invest your valuable resouces for the future."
현대생명과학연구세미나 ,Ten to twelve professors of the department each present their on-going research. The weekly schedule will be announced later.
생리학(2) ,"The objective of the class is to understand the basic concept on how 
organisms, organs, cells and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical 
functions that they have in a living system. 
In this semester, the class will cover the respiratory, gastrointenstinal, 
renal and endocrine systems."
GAME THEORY AND POLITICAL STRATEGY ,"This is an introductory course in game theory. Various applications will be considered.
 
This syllabus preview may be modified in the future."
SURVEY RESEARCH METHODS ,"This course is designed to introduce students to the methodology of survey research. We will consider all practical aspects of survey research and polling, from sampling to questionnaire design to methods of data collection to data analysis. The goal of the class is to give you an introduction to every major topic so you can become a well-informed consumer of surveys. By the end of the semester you will not be expert at everything, but you will learn enough to ask the right questions. Students interested in pursuing survey research are strongly encouraged to take additional classes on statistics and public opinion."
NATIONALISM AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN EAST ASIA ,"The Relations between nationalism and social movements have not been studied much, though both are social phenomena that are based on collective identities, which are the bases of politics of modern time.  Especially when we try to understand the international relations or political history of countries in East Asia, we often understand nationalisms in the region only as the roots of the conservative or even totalitarian political ideologies that reproduce the conservativism and deepen the conflicts between the countries in the region. This perspective is also related to the old prejudice of nationalism studies that regards non-Western nationalism as ethnic and dangerous. 
	This course aims to investigate the basic relations between nationalism and social movements in East Asia. First, this course investigates the changes in theories of social movements and explore how social movements and collective identities are connected. Second, understanding nationalism as ongoing process with the incessant competition between the groups in the society, this course reads the social movements in East Asia as attempts of creating collective identities countering robust official nationalist narratives. Given the strong nationalism as the condition of nation-building process of the countries in the region, this course will study how various counter narratives of nationalism emerge and the different intentions of creating collective identities from the groups that compete with the idea of favorable nation and state in the public sphere through specific cases of social movements based on nationalism."
"LAW, JUSTICE AND SOCIETY ","The course is designed to broaden students’ perspective towards law so that the students can understand law’s functioning in various social contexts and to encourage students to develop their ideas about controversial issues in law and society. This course encompasses theories and theoretical perspectives on law and society with extensive examples. Also, it focuses more on the constitutional law dimension when approaching the legal system and structure. This course, therefore, aims to give overall knowledge and information about Korean government and constitutional law. Modern Constitution and Administrative laws, including a wide variety of relative laws, rules, or orders, and principles, provide a broad contour for the nation that the rule of law and the democracy manifested in our society. 
In the rest of the term, specific topics will be discussed ? law and the economy, dispute resolution, the legal profession and legal education, and the judiciary in perspective of legal reform. In the last two weeks of the term, students will present their research."
BIOETHICS ,"Bioethics concerns ethical and policy issues surrounding life sciences research, medicine, and health policy. As technology advances, it raises ever more urgent questions about the proper division between science and biology, as new techniques make it easier than ever to produce the kinds of changes that usually take nature thousands of generations and millions of years to produce. Likewise, new medicines and procedures continually blur the line between what is an acceptable treatment and what is an unacceptable performance enhancer. Age-old questions abound as well, for example about the right to end one’s own life, or the moral status of an unborn fetus. Finally, all modern societies must deal with vexing policy issues regarding the just distribution of medical and other resources to support the health and welfare of even their poorest citizens. Although all of these issues have a distinctly ethical aspect, we will learn that the most responsible ethical positions must be heavily informed by practical understanding. Accordingly, this course will study the problems from the perspectives of philosophy, science, history, law, and economics to gain a better understanding of the real world consequences of our choices.

Target knowledge and skills to be developed:

- Understanding of the core issues in Bioethics
- Understanding the basis for making ethical and policy decisions
- Ethical and policy analysis
- Critical thinking and debate skills
- Clear and effective persuasive writing"
미국정치 ,"This course provides a sweeping overview of the American political tradition.  We will trace the origins of the United States Constitution and the development of the federal government, paying particular attention to the relationships among the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government and the distribution of power among political institutions across the national, state and local levels.  We also will explore broader questions about campaigns and elections, citizen participation and public opinion, as well the roles of political parties, interest groups and the news media.   You will be encouraged to think for yourself about the political development of the United States in a global context and communicate your views in a logical and persuasive manner."
THEORY OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS ,"By the conclusion of this course you will i)understand basic financial theory 
and practices, ii) develop the big picture of managerial finance so you can 
understand how things fit together, and iii) strengthen your skills in 
analyzing financial problems, identifying the issues, and making financial 
decision. Topical coverage will include: fundamental concepts of finance, time 
value of money, stock and bond valuation, risk & return, portfolo theory, CAPM, 
cost of capital, capital structure, and capital project evaluation methodologies."
보건정책세미나 ,"보건정책이란 무엇인지를 개관하고 그 후에는 현대사회에서 문제가 되고 있는 보건의료이슈들에 대한 바람직한 정책을 모색해보도록 함. 강사는 강의와 읽을거리를 통하여 학생들에게 대략의 정보와 방향성을 제시하지만 학생들이 스스로 토론을 통하여 특정 이슈에 대하여 자신들만의 논리적인 견해를 갖을 수 있도록 하는 것이 본 수업의 목표임. 

*본 과목은 고등교육혁신원 사회혁신가 인증 교과목에 해당되며, 수업과정 중 사회혁신 및 사회문제 해결과 관련한 내용의 강의 및 실습이 함께 포함됩니다. 아울러, 수업 내 학생 제출 결과물 중 일부는 고등교육혁신원에서 추후 사회혁실활동 결과물로 활용될 수 있습니다."
TECHNOLOGIES IN FINANCIAL INDUSTRY AND POLICY ,"Behind the stunning fa?ade of AI and Big Data, technologies are progressing from well-defined, pointwise, and deterministic problems toward not-well-defined problems, interpersonal problems, and/or even societal problems involving fluid, dynamic, and/or forward-looking situations without the unique solutions to necessitate choices and decisions. Even though where the progression will bring us might be quite different from our current expectations, the progression, however, will bring us to quite a different, probably unchartered, world. Here we would like to understand what the technologies are and improve our educated imagination power of new worlds. 

We will study the technologies such as AI, Big Data, and FinTech from the perspective of non-technical majors as well as their social and policy implication. Financial industry has been pioneering the technological developments for more than 20 years, though unnoticeable to most people. As such, developments in both traditional financial industry and upcoming financial industry (FinTech) would make up a significant part of the course."
GLOBALIZATION AND ITS ISSUES ,"Course Description:
Until 1980s, political theorists had a tendency to ignore or avoid 
international issues and focus on domestic political contexts. Since the end of 
twentieth century, however, the term “globalization” has been an all-purpose 
catchword not only in public opinion but also in scholarly debate. Today, it is 
impossible to understand world affairs without grasping the contemporary 
phenomenon of globalization.
But, what is globalization? What are its main issues? This course aims to help 
students to conceptualize globalization and its diverse dimensions such as 
political, economic, cultural, and ideological. Based on this understanding, 
students will investigate the following questions: how are goods, capital and 
people moving around the world in new ways?; how do these radical movements 
change politics locally and globally?; how do they relate to national security 
and national sovereignty?; how do we share the benefits of globalization?; Are 
there duties of global justice?; Does global justice require the development of 
global democratic institutions or a world state?; When and how is coercion or 
the use of force in world politics ever justified?  
While exploring these questions, students will learn to understand 
globalization as a complex phenomenon involving constant change in need of 
being reframed.
Course Objectives: 
This course will enable students to: 
1) Understand different dimensions of contemporary globalization. 
2) Critically examine current political, economic, and cultural events and 
issues of globalization in newspapers, films, and other media. 
3) Develop  her/his  own  interest  in  a  particular  issue  or  theme  
pertinent  to globalization by conducting a group presentation and writing two 
term papers based on individual research."
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY POLICY ,
지속가능한도시개발 ,
화공열역학(2) ,"This course deals with phase equilibrium and solution thermodynamics based on basic principle of thermodynamics. It is expected that students will be able to select appropriate relations and use them to evaluate the change of thermodynamic properties when system reaches equilibrium. Furthermore, student will be albe to examine non ideality of fluid mixture."
유기화학(2) ,"The course focuses on the basic concepts of organic chemistry, the methods used to identify the structure of organic molecules, electron pushing organic reaction mechanisms, and methods used for the synthesis of organic compounds. Thorough understanding of the topics covered in the Organic Chemistry 1 course is required.

PHARMACOLOGY ,"This course provides the basic concepts and scientific underpinnings of pharmacology including scientific principals to diseases prevention and rational use of drug. The goals are understanding the action of drug and underlying mechanism, rational use of drug, and drug development."
INTRODUCTION TO LITERARY STUDIES ,"This course provides an introduction to the study of narrative. We start with the premise
that short stories and novels are modes of thought with which writers and readers have
engaged with the world for centuries. Works of fiction tell stories that are continuously
being reimagined and rewritten. As readers, we are engaged in the project of rewriting,
finding new ways to relate fiction to our lives, connect with it, and make it meaningful to 
ourselves and others. In this course, students will develop a solid understanding of a
few key ideas about how narrative works and a vocabulary for describing it.
Lectures and discussion will attend not only to close readings of selected works of 
fiction, but also engage with questions about what literature is and what we do when
we read and write about it."
INTRODUCTION TO ACADEMIC WRITING ,"This course will help you develop academic reading and writing skills. You 
will practice reading strategies, as well as how to write different types of 
paragraphs and essays; various language points will also be studied."
TOPICS IN MEDIA AND POPULAR CULTURE ,"The aim of this course is to understand contemporary cinema through the perspective of gender studies. Students will be introduced to current interpretive concepts at the intersection of film studies and gender studies and learn to apply them to film texts. Each week there will be two types of assignment: critical essays and select films addressing the issues of gender and sexuality, which we will synthesize into fresh interpretations, critiquing both in the process. The goal of the exercise will be an outlook on contemporary discourse--from ideas to practices--in the arena of gender and sexuality."
주니어세미나(CHIRALITY AT THE NANOSCALE) ,"Name of the Course: Chirality at the Nanoscale 

This course will give UIC students an overview of interdisciplinary field of chiral nanomaterials which successfully combines the chemistry, physics, biology and materials science. Major types of chiral nanostructures (from DNA nanoassemblies to carbon nanotubes and metal nanoparticles) will be presented on primary literature examples. Applications of chiral materials in sensing, medicine and synthesis will be discussed. Molecular models will be used to explain chirality at the nanoscale. Students will prepare posters where they will summarize they chirality literature research."
주니어세미나(NEURAL NETWORK AND DEEP LEARNING) ,"This course, titled as `neural network and deep learning`, studies the neural structure of the brain and its applicational computer algorithm, called deep learning. Followed by two lectures by the instructor, two teaching assistants will explain about actual programming of deep learning in Matlab or Python for additional four hours. The remaining of this course will consist of presentation of the participating students about their research presentations on neural network (theory) or deep learning (programming)."
KOREAN WRITING AND CHINESE CHARACTER ,"This course is designed to enhance the writing skill of undergraduate at 
UIC. Combining reading comprehension, discussion, and writing training 
together, the class equips students not only to have a better command of 
modern Korean, including Sino-Korean/Chinese vocabularies, in terms of logical and 
critical thinking, but also to improve academic writing prepared for research 
capacity at college level. In particular, discussion will center on 
presentation as one of major class activities for the betterment of 
communication skills while writing exercise, based on assigned readings, will 
enhance critical thinking. For this purpose, the course material provides with 
students a list of selected Korean writings from the newspapers, magazines, 
and books in modern Korean."
BASIC DRAWING 2 ,"This course deals with drawing techniques with a focus on  developing skills 
in observation, visual sensitivity, and concrete expression.
Students will learn the basic elements of drawing, including lines, planes, 
forms, light, value, color based on color theory ."
APPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY ,"Technology is a tool. It always has been throughout time. Humankind makes use of technology to solve the issues we face on a daily basis. These issues range from our quality-of-life to the survival of our species.

In this class we choose an issue facing our society, identity solutions and examine several technologies we can use to solve this issue. Available technologies are augmented reality, virtual reality, mobile applications.

Each student will walk away from this class with a proposal, and a working prototype of their solution."
INNOVATION HUBS: INTEGRATING TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN ,"Technology and Design can and have been considered separate fields. Interaction between the two has occurred only when the production process required their collaboration. That is the past. Today the lines between technology and design are fading to where they are codependent on each other if not actually the same. Integrating Technology and Design covers the wide range of possibilities when technology and design are considered as equal parts of a greater whole. In this class we can regard a working technology and a finished design as incomplete without it’s counterpart.

In this class, students are positioned to design a solution as well as implement the technology supporting the design. The final projects will be working prototypes that illustrate the integration, and necessary fusion of Technology and Design. Projects can use software or hardware based technologies as well as screen based 2D, 3D, or industrial designs in nature.

It is not necessary for the technology to be build from the ground up. The students will be introduced to resources for using open-source software and hardware as well as physical designs for their prototypes. 

Integrating Technology and Design presents an opportunity to benefit from the collaboration between technology and design, understand why this is already happening in the larger tech companies as well as startups, and produce a working prototype that takes advantage of this union."
CONTEXT MAPPING ,"“Designing Playable Cities : Game Design in the Urban Context”
Context mapping is a qualitative design research approach that invites 
contextually aggregated data, owners of the data, and actors to innovative 
design spaces. It has originally evolved for designing and developing 
innovative products and services in a co-creative design process, while 
it critically focuses on user experiences embedded in the everyday life. 
The approach is seamlessly linked to the idea of the living lab, the 
emerging new research technique for designing IoT. By the generative 
techniques of context mapping, we could facilitate a living lab setting 
more relevant and organic. 

In the 2018 fall semester, Context mapping class will look into the field of 
urban digital experience that is effectively conceptualized by game design 
technologies, and social interaction frameworks. The prior knowledge 
on basic 3D and game engine are essentially positive to comprehend the 
coursework and homework."

동아시아사회비교 ,"This undergraduate course provides a comparative and theoretical introduction 
to the recent social transformation of East Asian societies. In the first 
half, we will study the reform and opening up of ""Actually Existing Socialism"" 
in China. For this, we will read the theories of Marx and Lenin to make sense 
of issues in post-socialist transformation. Socialism in theory by Marx and 
Lenin used to be an alternative vision to western, liberal capitalism to some 
countries, but socialism in reality has been disasterous and almost 
disappeared on earth. The topics of working class politics, human rights and 
democracy, resistance and struggle from below, and globalization will be 
discussed.

In the second half, we will move to the topics of gender and citizenship. For 
this, we will read a few articles by contemporary feminists, then examine the 
contemporary issues faced by women and minority in East Asia. In this part, we 
will collectively examine and grapple with the problem of social exclusion and 
discrimination in East Asia today."

"문화,경제와지식재산권 ","우리나라 경제의 성장엔진은 제조업 중심에서 문화산업 쪽으로 변하고 있다. 한류라는 용어가 K-pop으로 바뀐 것에서 알 수 있듯 우리의 문화 산업은 한자를 쓰는 동아시아 중심의 문화권역에서 전세계로 확산된 지 오래되었다. 문화산업을 지원하는 방법은 여러 가지가 있을 수 있는데, 그 중 하나가 저작권, 특허권, 상표권과 같은 지식재산권에 의한 보호다. 문화산업과 가장 밀접한 관련 있는 권리는 저작권이라 할 수 있는데, 문화산업의 보호를 위해 저작권 등 지식재산권은 강력히 보호하는 것만이 능사가 아니다. 때로는 이용자의 편의와 새로운 문화산업 창조를 위해 저작권을 제한하는 것이 요구되기도 한다. 여기에서 경제학적 관점이 도입되기도 한다. 지식재산권은 법에 의해 독점이 허용된다는 점에서 경제학적으로는 공유경제, 선진국 편중현상으로서 일종의 남북문제 측면에서 강력한 도전을 받기도 한다. 이와 같은 여러 관점을 조합하여 문화, 경제, 지식재산권을 살펴보고자 한다."

SHINHAN SEMINAR: LITERATURE ,"Ever since Kafka’s stories and fragmentary novels began to appear, readers have recognized a difficult interpretative problem, which can be briefly described in the following way:  even if no “moral” or “doctrine” governs Kafka’s work, it nevertheless still seems to teach us something that is otherwise inaccessible.  The following question therefore arises:  what is the content of his teaching, the “doctrine” that can be extracted from immersion in his work?   Among the first and most significant attempts to reflect on the source of this question?and propose an answer that does not betray the integrity of Kafka’s idea of literature?is found in Walter Benjamin’s late writings.  The aim of this seminar is to read Kafka’s writings in light of Benjamin’s critical program and, conversely, to analyze, from the perspective of its conception of literature, the critical program Benjamin began to pursue soon after he became acquainted with Kafka’s work.  The texts under consideration will be:  some of Kafka’s so-called “Z?rau Fragments,” his short story entitled “The Judgment,” a selection of his animal stories, and the first and final chapters of his unfinished novel The One Who Disappeared (also known as Amerika); Benjamin’s 1934 essay “Franz Kafka: On the Tenth Anniversary of His Death,” some of his conversations with Brecht, a letter he wrote to Gershom Scholem on Kafka, and a small selection of reflections on the idea of the dialectical image, and his “Theological-Political Fragment.”"
TOPICS IN JAPANESE LITERATURE AND CULTURE ,"UIC Seminar: Topics in Japanese Literature and Culture: “Mishima Yukio (1925-1970): Between Philosophical Rebel and Literary Genius”

MISHIMA Yukio is one of Japan’s foremost modern authors. His public suicide in the aftermath of a failed military coup is a memorable episode that left perhaps as strong an impression on the world literary scene as his oeuvre itself. Beyond the obvious scandal, however, the link between life and work in the public reception of Mishima is exciting from a theoretical point of view. In short, Mishima’s was a life of performance, of perpetual attempt to negotiate ideal and reality, myth and farce, or truth and ideology; and his artistic production a most visible arena thereof. 

In this class, we will read Mishima’s final novels, planned and executed as a tetralogy, which was to showcase the culmination of his literary cum political endeavors of the preceding two decades. Upon its completion, Mishima went on, according to his plan, to commit the aforementioned public ritual suicide. In order to interrogate the literature-politics knot, which organizes and disturbs Mishima’s oeuvre, we will supplement the novels with excerpts of philosophical-essayistic oeuvre of Georges Bataille, a French thinker whom Mishima admired and felt a great affinity for. Come prepared to be scandalized, to feel, to think!"
TOPICS IN CLASSICAL GREEK PHILOSOPHY ,"While ""politics"" has now become a universal term for all the activities associated with all manner of human governance, the word originated in a very specific historical context: the city-state (polis) of Ancient Greece. The polis, and especially the democratic polis of Athens, represented an unusual experiment in the organization of human life, and indeed the polis, in a strict sense, only really thrived for a few hundred centuries. Yet it is not only the concept of politics, as well as the scientific, rational study of the political, that arose during this short and exceptional period of human history, but also many other concepts that have subsequently come to be regarded as of universal value, including philosophy, science, and reason.  
The aim of this course is to study key texts of Classical Greek political thought, ranging from the Presocratics and Sophists and early Platonic dialogues, to the middle and late works of Plato, and, finally the ethical and political thought of Aristotle."
LITERATURE AND PSYCHOANALYSIS ,"UIC Seminar: Psychoanalysis and Literature (“Freud’s Case Histories”)

The relation between psychoanalysis and literature is at once evident and mysterious. As Freud defines it, a literary text is an expression of the author’s fantasies; and, as he practices it, psychoanalysis is a thoroughly narrative endeavor. It seems that literature was psychoanalysis avant la lettre; and psychoanalysis the raison d’?tre of literature. In short, any attribution of relative significance or ontological priority seems doomed as well as ill-conceived. Significantly, such affinity is not to be translated into identity. Indeed, psychoanalysis and literature continue to be productive precisely in that narrow space of proximate difference; so is it here that criticism?literary interpretation interlocked with analysis ? la psychoanalysis?thrives. With this ambiguity as the guiding principle, we will practice close reading (a literary critical act par excellence) with Freud’s most famed case histories (psychoanalytical material par excellence), with the aim of articulating the affinity-in-difference of the two most important disciplines of the modern ?poque. Be ready to encounter most intriguing expressions of the human psyche (re)presented in clinical narratives that are themselves inquisitive, obsessive, and fascinating."
"CULTURE, MEDIA, AND THE POLITICS OF BEAUTY ","This course is an exploration of human sensibilities, taste and desire through a wide array of inter-disciplinary readings in cultural anthropology, literature, and theory.  One of the central focuses will be ‘beauty,’ not so much the object, but more importantly the politics surrounding its notion and manifestation. We live in an era of inundation of media that operate as means of production, dissemination and consumption of the information, images and imaginations that constitute the material and non-material aspect of our culture. We will begin with an on-line reading, “Performing the Nation” and examine how the notion of beauty operates on multiple levels in realms such as class, ethnic and national politics and cultural practices."
PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOANALYSIS ,The Freudian Unconscious.
ASIA EXTREME AND ASIAN AMERICAN CULTURAL POLITICS ,"The aim of this course is to probe into the nature of the Asian-ness (or Oriental-ness) 
that informs contemporary American literary and cinematic narratives on the East. 
Throughout the semester, we will examine the diverse narrative strategies that exoticize, 
eroticize, spiritualize and even demonize the East, and ask questions about their political 
ramifications. To a certain degree, Asian American writers` narrativization of their cultural 
legacies is not an exception to this kind of marketing of Asia. This scrutiny, however, is 
not designed just to confirm the well-known Saidian insight into the hegemony of Orientalism 
but to bring to light the often-conflictual inner dynamism of the target text that bears witness 
to the limits of its own ideology, be it assimilationist or subversive."
THE CULTURAL POLITICS OF THE 21ST CENTURY ,"As the possibilities of individual and collective life flounder spectacularly under the pressures of modernity (increasing rate of environmental catastrophe, ceaseless state violence, the crisis of liberal democratic civility and the renewed rise of the far right ? to name just a few cheery examples), this class turns to contemporary literature and scholarship that interrogate just what possibilities remain. What terms are produced to describe the linguistic, temporal and spatial conditions of the present? What modes of subjectivity are still available? How hopeful or disenchanted should we be?

We will begin with recent critiques of education, labor, and global development, moving on to key political theories about how society should be organized. Might economic rationality itself be a fiction of sorts, one whose narrative structure and conceptions of the human agent have taken a powerful hold on our imagination? What new fictions of political economy must thus be scripted? We will also attend to the dimensions of affect so central to recent discourse, i.e. how feelings both construct and resist contemporary politics. Finally, we will read some sublime and visionary literary works that imagine history beyond the “Anthropocene.”

We will create and maintain a blog on which everyone will post their thoughts on a weekly basis. The blog entries are free in form, aimed at getting you to produce a genuine response to the texts and issues at hand. Consider it a public journal of sorts. You will also conduct research throughout the semester to produce an extended thesis with multiple secondary sources. At the end of the semester, we will hold a ""conference"" in which everyone will present their research."
LITERATURE AND LAW ,"This course explores philosophical and literary texts that have iconic status in Western literature, which grapple with the questions of law, justice, and mercy. While this course may no doubt benefit those who are interested in choosing legal profession as their career, it is open to anyone wishing to reflect on the relationship between the two rival orders of ""fiction"": the man-made law and the representations of law authored by creative writers. At the heart of this dialogue of literature and law stands the question of (secular and ultimately, divine) ""justice,"" which would be the overriding theme of our investigation. Since the (fictional, philosophical, religious) texts to be met with in this course are great masterpieces in themselves, (re-)reading them under the rubric of ""literature and law"" should in itself be an ample reward for your choosing this course."
INTRODUCTION TO LITERARY STYLISTICS ,"Stylistics aims to render literary judgments about literary texts 
comprehensible by focussing attention on the linguistic choices embodied in 
literary texts. The goal of the course s to introduce you to some of the most 
exciting stylistic analysis and apply it to a variety of literary and filmic 
texts."
COMPARATIVE CULTURAL STUDIES ,"This course will examine some major texts on comparative cultural studies with special emphasis on philosophical backgrounds. Selections from works of Hegel, Heidegger, Wittgenstein and others will be discussed with critical lectures on issues in aestheics and philosophy of art. As a class, we will also watch or listen to actual performances of classical music, followed by subsequent discussions."
HUMANITIES AND RELATED FIELDS ,"The tradition of Humanities has never been estranged from issues found in social, scientific, and aesthetic fields. Rather than focusing on a single subject in Humanities, this course attempts to extensively examine the connection between Humanities and other related fields. Including the already familiar topics like Literature and Law or Literature and Film, we can think about the liaison between Humanities and Music, Painting, Science (Technology), Economics, and Political Thought, etc."
금융과경제데이터 ,"The modern financial world express her expectation toward the future through financial instruments under the umbrella of financial institutions. Even though the expectation is dominantly based on the current and past economic states seen through the lenses of economics, the difficulties in connecting financial market and economics still stand steep to most students. Here, we introduce financial instruments, institution, and market from the perspective of economics, and re-introduce economic indices from the standpoint of financial market to lay down the cornerstone toward applying understanding of economics to financial market and extracting financial market’s expectation of future economic states."
산학협동현장실습-글로벌인턴십 ,
COLD WAR INTERNATIONAL HISTORY ,"This course will be an interest for students majoring in international studies, political sciences, and anyone else who is concerned over world history, international relations, foreign policy and diplomacy. The Cold War period is looked at through the lens of the predation theory that explains raising state strategy toward declining great powers (more in “Rising Titans, Falling Giants” by Shifrinson, Joshua R. Itzkowitz, Cornell University Press, 2018)."
INTRODUCTION TO INTERNATIONAL LAW ,"This course will introduce International Public Law to the novice and will put it in the context of International Relations. In fact, course and textbook intentionally put the themes, topics, and discussions at the interface of International Public Law and International Relations.
The place and functions of international law, the interactions with other fields of policy and academic disciplines, and the evolution of ‘the law’ over time are emphasized dynamics and recurring themes in this course."
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS AND GLOBAL MANAGEMENT ,"This course is intended to study and understand 
1) basic financial knowledge including IRR, duration, options, CAPM and etc., 
2) What you might have to do financial analysis,
3) what happened to the world during 2008 global financial turmoil, and 
4) How to invest your valuable resources for the future."
"EAST ASIA: STATE, SOCIETY AND CULTURE ","This course touches upon various contemporary issues in East Asia and makes students to think through history and cultural dynamics. 
This semester, we would like to emphasize 3 themes. 
1. Nationalism and Gender--the history of the development of feminist ideas in Asia, and how  women were involved in wartime efforts, especially, the predicaments of modern girls and new women in colonial period. Compare Japan and Korea.
2. Culture and Politics in colonial and postcolonial times--What is ""justice""? What were the everyday life of colonial times like, and how do we imagine them in contemporary setting? 
3. Cold War in Asia from a comparative perspective"

in the animals."
KOREAN POLITICS AND DEMOCRACY ,"The ‘Korean way’ of politics has perplexed and intrigued scholars and policy-
makers for a long time. The Republic of Korea(South Korea) has attained a rare 
but exemplary success, as it achieved both spectacular economic growth and 
political liberalization. Yet recently there have been an increasing number of 
intellectual and political debates both inside and outside the country on 
whether the country can cope with the consequences of further political and 
economic “maturation.”  Since South Korea has, in recent history, toppled 
authoritarian military regimes and built one of the most affluent economies, 
this course will also examine how Koreans themselves think of what democracy 
and governance mean to them and how their country needs to identify herself as 
a global power.  As we tack back and forth between democratization theories 
and the Korean experience, we will pursue the following topics: civil society 
vs. authoriatarian state, the rise and fall of the minjung ideology and 
student movement, the legacy of Japanese colonial occupation and the Korean 
War, ethinic natinalism and Korea`s response to globalizationvs, and the 
shadow of North Korea--human rights and nuclear threats--in domestic politics."
동아시아국제관계영어원강 ,"One of the most important questions in studying international politics is how to promote cooperation under anarchy. In this course we will study different perspectives of international relations including realism, neorealism, liberalism, neoliberal institutionalism, constructivism, and strategic perspective and discuss global and regional governance for peace and stability of the East Asian region. Issues reviewed during the course will include the North Korean Nuclear Issues, Nuclear Proliferation, the Rise of China and the US-China hegemonic competition, South Korea`s foreign and security policies, and Korea`s national security and its middle power role in the region."
정치분석연습영어원강 ,"This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the research process, focusing on both quantitative and qualitative methods appropriate for the empirical study of political phenomena.

COSMOPOLITANISM AND CRITICS ,"The course will explore the cosmopolitan ideal in contemporary political theory and practice.   The first half of the course will present the idea of cosmopolitanism in relation to theoretical debates on patriotism and nationalism and then in relation to dynamics surrounding international migration, global civil society and transnational advocacy networks.  The second half of the course will apply understandings of cosmopolitanism to selected global issues, such as nuclear proliferation, environmental protection and climate change, world poverty, and global governance.  This semester the course also includes a symposium on South Korean refugee policy that will include conversations with key practitioners on this issue and lead to an interactive assignment.

"INTERNATIONAL LAW, POLITICS AND DISPUTE SETTLEMENT ","This course aims to introduce to students international disputes and their settlement mechanisms from the legal and political perspectives. Students will explore and discuss why there have been many inter-state disputes and how these issues have been dealt with and settled at the international level. 

This course focuses on territoria & maritime issues that are one of the most controversial and important global topics nowadays."
PUBLIC CHOICE ,"This syllabus preview is *subject to change.* *Please attend the first day of the class for the most accurate information.* 

We aim to apply economic analyses to the study of politics.

We will examine various topics including cooperation, collective action, group choice, voting, governance, democratic and non-democratic political systems, international organizations, bureaucracy, leadership and more from the public choice perspective.

We will discuss both the possibilities and limitations of this approach."

THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY ,"Defining presidential power and understanding the process of presidential policy-making has been a mystifying task for students of the presidency as well as its practitioners. Many tools of social science have been applied to the study of the presidency, including psychological theories, sophisticated econometric techniques, historical analysis, and survey research. In this course we will survey some of this work in an attempt to understand the role of the president in the political system. We will examine the various theoretical approaches to studying the presidency, presidential selection, presidential power, interbranch relations, the role of the public, political parties, and the media, and presidential policy-making in foreign and domestic policy. I will also provide a historical perspective, emphasizing changes in the nature of the presidency in the 200-year history of the United States. Many of the examples of a given concept or topic will come from the Trump presidency, but we will draw on the experiences of other presidents as well. Obviously, this is an unusual time for the American presidency. One of the goals of this class is to give you the tools to place this recent experience in a broader historical and institutional context.

The goal of this class is to provide you with an understanding of how the president operates within the US political system. What makes for a successful president? How can we explain why some presidents succeed and others fail? How can we make sense of the current presidency - how is it similar to and different than previous presidencies?"
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION AND INSTITUTION ,"Major goals of this course are to understand and analyze the role of international-governmental and non-governmental-organizations (IOs) in world politics, including their creation, internal dynamics, and their complicated relationship with state behaviors. In the contemporary world politics, IOs have significant impacts on the decision-making in many issue areas: security, human rights, trade, environment, public health, and so on. However, the contention and controversies over its role and effectiveness are still ongoing. Against this backdrop, this course examines contending issues of IOs through different frameworks and social scientific tools.  By taking this course, students will learn analytical skills in social science and practices of IOs through class discussion, group activities, and writing assignments."
SEMINAR ON GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ,"This course investigates the idea of global citizenship in academic discourse as well as in everyday political and social life.    We will explore global citizenship in relation to debates in political theory and international relations as well as dynamics surrounding international migration, transnational advocacy networks, and global governance.   We will also apply various understandings of global citizenship in addressing key global issues, including nuclear proliferation, climate change, economic inequality and the challenges posed by populism and authoritarianism.  Our course will also include a special interactive component through live conversations via Skype with students at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles."
아시아정치론 ,"This class is an advanced research seminar on politics of Asia. Analyzing domestic politics, international politics, and their interactions of Asian countries, near and far, becomes indispensable for everyone?no matter what you study and pursue?in this globalized era. In this vein, analyzing politics of Asian countries, Asian regions, and Asia as a whole would be a priority. We will try to conduct a series of systematic research on those research subjects that revolves around Asian politics as an individual researcher as well as a research team. Each semester has a primary theme to pursue such as the multilayered politics of Asian middling states between the challenging China and the hegemonic US. Note that (1) this class has a clear purpose of academic and policy research practice for those who aims at producing area specialist (region and country), who understands every level of analysis from individual to globe, to enter academia, policy community, and private sectors; (2) the students will lead and find the best way to design their own research project, execute it and create some relevant and creative final products to share with any stakeholders in the related fields; and (3) this class uses some alternative ways to pursue the research subjects such as multimedia sessions, special guest lectures, and so forth."
정치이론과철학 ,"This course is designed to analyze comparatively Rawls and Habermas on politics 
expressed in the books of Political Liberalism and Between Facts and Norms by 
reading carefully their important chapters. Specifically. It attempts to 
examine not only the methodology, political constructivism and the theory of 
communicative action, that the two theorists employ respectively, but also 
major ideas such as justice, law, public reason, communicative action and 
reason, and public sphere. It traces theoretical distinction and meaning as 
well as practical implications to contemporary liberal democracies or 
constitutional democracies."
BARGAINING APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ,"This course aims to provide you with the background and conceptual tools that are necessary to understand the problems and issues of world politics. In this course, you will be introduced to the wide range of issues that make up the study of world politics, including the causes of international conflict and violence, international economic relations, and politics related to human rights, foreign aid, etc. These issues will be analyzed using the basic elements of the study of world politics (i.e., actors, choices, preferences, and consequences of state interactions) and important mechanisms that underpin domestically (e.g., the role of democracy in explaining war) and internationally (e.g., the role of international institutions in explaining trade). The class is designed such that I lecture on Wednesday for two hours and students present their readings on Monday."
PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF LAW AND POLITICS ,"“Scarcely any political question arises…that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question.” Alexis de Tocqueville

What is the ‘law?’ What informs it? When is it ‘valid’ and why do we respect it? How is the law different from an autocrat’s commands? Are law and ‘justice’ always the same? If not, do we have a duty to respect the law? To address these and related questions, we consider the law’s nature, norms, and justifications. Our core question is: What is institutionally and morally classified as the ‘law?’ 

Our approach is interdisciplinary and covers major twentieth- and twenty-first century schools of legal philosophy, especially Legal Positivism, Natural Law, American Legal Realism, and Critical Legal Studies. 

WE CONSIDER THE LAW’S PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS THROUGH SIX MODULES: 

(1)	WHAT IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW AND WHY DO WE CARE? 
(2)	LEGAL POSITIVISM 
(3)	NATURAL LAW AND OTHER CRITICS OF POSITIVISM  
(4)	EXCLUSIVE v. INCLUSIVE POSITIVISM
(5)	SOCIOLOGICAL ? (US) REALISM SCHOOLS
(6)	CRITICAL LEGAL STUDIES

We approach each topic with explanatory text, original text, lectures, and class discussions. I will introduce topics with a lecture (including PPTs), and then we will discuss some leading literature in the field. Periodically, we will hold student moot courts where we will apply class materials to debate issues. Students may introduce ‘real-world’ events, so that we may consider practical applications. Students will question assumptions, critique and develop arguments, evaluate normative claims, originate ideas, and become better prepared to confront complex social problems. They will improve analytical, writing, discussion, and presentation skills.

I MAY REVISE THE SYLLABUS BEFORE FIRST CLASS DAY. 
I WILL PROVIDE A FINAL SYLLABUS ON FIRST CLASS DAY.

CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS STUDENT PROGRESS, MAY REQUIRE 
SYLLABUS MODIFICATIONS DURING THE SEMESTER.
ANY CHANGES ANNOUNCED IN ADVANCE."

SOCIAL MEDIA AND SOCIETY ,"Digital media has had a major impact on the way we relate to ourselves, to each other, and to the wider world. This course will explore, among other things, the resulting effect on our personal and social psychology, politics, epistemology, and economics. Along the way, we will consider which parts of digital media show the most promise for providing a net benefit for human welfare, and which parts ought to be avoided/neutralized as much as possible. These issues will all be considered from both a personal and a policy perspective."
PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ,"This course is a critical, reflective examination of the nature of technology 
as well as the effects and transformation of technologies in human knowledge, 
societies, and environments. Its aim is to understand, evaluate, and criticize 
the ways in which technologies reflect as well as change human life 
individually and socially. Therefore, the task is to analyze the phenomeon of 
technology, its significance, and the ways that it mediates and transforms our 
lives.

SOCIAL INNOVATION IN A CHALLENGING WOLRD ,Junior and senior students (UIC only)
HISTORY OF GLOBALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT ,"This course examines the historical link between globalization and its 
impact on world development. While there are many different definitions 
for globalization, we will primarily focus on the unprecedented 
movement of capital, people, and information that followed the 
industrial revolution and the introduction of key technologies that 
interconnected the globe. We will also focus on issues such as 
the emergence of the world market for commodities, 
global consumption patterns and migration.

The first section of the course highlights various aspects of 
globalization from a historical perspective that will enable 
students to better understand the forces that shape the modern world. 
The second section then considers the fate of world development 
after World War II and focuses on three case studies of Africa, 
Latin America and East Asia. Students who take the course will gain 
a critical foundation for examining the history of development as well as 
broader insignts into the forces of globalization that shape our world 
today."
DEVELOPMENT FIELD RESEARCH ,"In this course, we will study what tools are used to explore human development in the field pertaining to issues such as, health, gender, the family, nutrition, risk, technology adoption, public policy and institutions. While studying each of these topics, we will ask: What determines the decisions of poor households in developing countries? What constraints are they subject to? Is there a scope for policy (by government, international organizations, or NGOs)? What policies have been tried out? Have they been successful? 

Throughout the course, you will be exposed to modern empirical methods in economics, and in particular to randomized control trials. Moreover, you will learn about various facets of these projects, from experimental design to ethical issues to data collection and analysis.

This class is designated as a Social Innovation Certificate (SIC) course. The course contents and practices will be related to social innovation and social problem solving. 
Also, Institute of Higher Education Innovation (IHEI) may collect and accumulate student assignments and course contents for further purpose."
POLITICAL ECONOMY OF CLIMATE CHANGE ,"This course brings students to the research frontier in the political economy of climate change. The major goal of this course is to understand the theoretical dynamics of climate change in the fields of political science and economics. This course also aims to explore practical issues related to political and economic discourses on climate change. To achieve these goals, this course covers a wide range of topics, but the primary emphasis is understanding how the political and economic dimensions of climate change result in domestic policies and international relations. The class consists of lectures and discussions, and students’ active participation in the discussions is highly anticipated. Students are expected to read a variety of reading materials and write short and long papers to fulfill the requirements of this course."

urbanization and rural-urban migration, health, education, the environment, 
and international trade and finance, problems of debt burdens, foreign aid, 
and private and foreign investment."
IMPERIALISM AND THE WORLD ,"This focuses on a period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and its linkages with the development of capitalism and liberalism. In this period, imperial countries served to establish a global order by connecting different parts of the world. The growth of capitalism was the fuel for expansion of imperialism, which led to the spreading of Western ideas of liberalism globally. Such developments can be considered as having long-term positive effects on the modern world, which is both effectively organised and highly interdependent. On the other hand, period of imperialism is one of the most controversial periods in world history what includes global conflicts, bloody disputes based on race, gender or religion, severe exploitation and horrendous extraction of natural resources, building empires monetary gain, etc."

(students will pick artists  for discussion.)"
AS LHP: MEMORY AND MEMORIALIZATION IN ASIA AND BEYOND ,"Memory is a fraught enterprise. For how a past is known and remembered is complicated by murky beginnings, inconclusive endings, multiple parties, and varied interests. Yet, more than ever before, with increasing intensity, visibility, and urgency, we are witnessing renewed calls to remember the past--so as to correct history, seek redress, and find justice. Now is an opportune moment, therefore, to reflect on why issues have come to be formulated in terms of remembering and forgetting and to consider why and how we remember--for what purpose, for whom, and from which position.

This is a course on memory and memorialization, that is, a course on why and how we remember and commemorate the past. We will question: How can we remember beyond re-authenticating what has already come down to us? How can we attempt to fill in the gaps of given knowledges without re-establishing yet another regime of totality? Why do we engage in commemoration and memorialization? What might be the significance of such ritual acts? How can we go beyond remembering our own to remembering our own and others? And, finally, how can we begin to imagine and enact a more just and ethical memory?

We will look into various forms and sites of memory and memorialization--from memoirs and testimony to short stories, novels, and films to memorials and museums--across time and space. Since knowing the past cannot be divorced from the contexts within which such recall occurs, we will also situate the study of memory alongside history. Some of the issues with which we will be concerned include the impact of trauma on memories, the relationship between individual/private and collective/public, the conflict between historical documentation and artistic representation, the dialectics of remembering and forgetting, the consumption of memory, and the struggle for a just future."
INTRODUCTION TO EAST ASIAN ART ,"This course is designed to understand the basic knowledge of East Asian art and aims at a comparative study with neighboring countries focusing on Korean art history. Each semester, a specific topic is selected for in-depth study and this semester theme focuses on studying ""what masterpieces are in premodern East Asia.”"
BUSINESS MODELS IN CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ,"As the fastest-growing facet of the Internet, digital business offers new ways 
of doing business that no company can afford to ignore. The basis for moving 
to digital business is a belief that digital markets have the potential to be 
more efficient in developing new information goods and services. However, the 
fundamentals of business still hold for digital business. Students taking this 
module will learn about the various types of business models based on the use 
of information technology. They will also learn how to analyze and design 
business models. 

This course covers the following topics:

ECONOMICS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION ,"This course is designed to provide a working knowledge of economic principles and real world practices on a range of topics pertaining to technology and innovation. 
After the brief overview of fundamentals of economics, we will cover various topics including (1) dynamic process of innovation and corporate strategy such as disruptive innovation, vertical integration vs. modularization, learning curve, and determinants of R&D intensity; (2) success and failure of innovative activities; (3) utilization issues of innovation output including first-mover advantage, battles for winner-take-all, patents and standards.
Although the course covers many important concepts of economics, we will focus on their applications into the real business decisions, rather than the economic theory itself."
ART MANAGEMENT ,"This course focuses on not-for-profit arts organizations and related bodies in cultural creative industries. Topics covered include the evolution of the field, economic impact, value creation, the intrinsic and effectual structure, marketing, fundraising, and others. Students will be introduced to a wide range of arts organizations and its projects, working as arts managers through lectures, readings and project research. In addition to understanding the organizational structures and functions of an arts organization, students will have begun to develop a philosophy of management in the arts, a theoretical model for general management, and practical tools of its practice."
SCIENCE IN SOCIETY ,"In addition to the content focus, the goal of this course is to learn to write a sustained philosophical argument.  To earn an A+ students must also submit their paper to an (undergraduate) philosophy journal (Here’s a list: http://www.gvsu.edu/philosophy/undergraduate-philosophy-journals-16.htm).
The best papers will:

1) Make a single focused argument in which the paper clearly sets up the terrane of previous work and makes a small original contribution to the literature.
2) Present an explicit argumentative structure that is followed in the paper.  Specific suggestions for writing a great paper can be found here: http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html
3) Be accessible and interesting to your parents (for example).  The best paper should be self-contained?an intelligent person unfamiliar with the course material could understand what you are saying in your paper and why it is important."
LAW AND TECHNOLOGY ,"This course explains the characteristics of the blockchain and the legal issues surrounding the blockchain.  The course will start with an overview of cryptocurrencies and how blockchain works.  We then explore how blockchain is currently being used in the finance sector and can be used in the future for corporate governance, storing public information and creating registries.  We also take a look at smart contracts and its legal significance in the context of contract law.  A theme throughout the course is to understand how blockchain can be the underlying infrastructure for emerging technologies such as big data, IOT, and artificial intelligence.  The purpose of this course is for students to understand the blockchain and assess the possible legal implications.  Students will have the opportunity to read and discuss legislation and court cases in addition to the text book, recent articles and whitepapers involving the blockchain.  This will be a good introductory course for students interested in pursuing law or technology as a career."
THE GOOD LIFE ,
MODERN GERMAN HISTORY ,"The horrors of the twelve-year rule of the Nazi regime (1933-45) ? the Second World War, the murder of six million European Jews and the neologism, “genocide,” which it inspired ? have provided an ugly hallmark for the analysis of modern German history.  Historians have interpreted the century preceding the “Third Reich” and the post-war period through the lenses of German fascism and the Holocaust.  However, the collapse of the German Democratic Republic and German (re-)unification in 1990 created havoc with many historical narratives of modern Germany.  The new Germany and the relative success of the European Union have re-shaped settled interpretations of the past.  As Germans, and their observers, look forward ? with optimism, resignation, or pessimism ? to an inscrutable future, their interpretations of the recent past become that much more divisive."
STUDIES IN SHAKESPEARE ,"This course will provide an introduction to Shakespeare`s sonnets and plays. Some of the key themes and aspects of Shakespeare`s works that will
be considered are language, identity, performativity, artifice, kingship, madness, sexuality, mortality, self-reflexivity, and so forth. The first week of 
class, we will examine several of Shakespeare`s sonnets; over the course of the remaining weeks of the semester we will read half a dozen plays 
drawn from the four different genres of the Bard`s corpus: comedy, tragedy, history, and late romance. The actual plays will be decided the first week
of class, based on student interest."
TOPICS IN GENDER STUDIES ,"Gender in Korean Fiction and Film

This course explores the changing representations of gender in Korean fiction and film. We will analyze how Korean writers and directors imagine and portray gender--femininity, masculinity, and in-between--to consider the evolution of gender in Korean society and the role played by culture in shaping our understanding of what it is to be a wo/man in Korea.

We will first examine the category of gender and then move on to investigating how fiction and film--as cultural products--influence and are influenced by the historical shifts and transformations of Korea: colonization, the Korean War, modernization and industrialization, democratization, and neoliberal globalization. We will question: How did colonial modernity beget notions of modern manhood/womanhood? How did war and militarization construct ideas of hegemonic masculinity? How did--does--the state mold, mobilize, and manage gender norms? What new conflicts in gender relations have risen in Korea today?

This course aims for students to: (a) become familiar with modern Korean history, fiction, and film; (b) gain critical perspectives on the construction, representation, and evolution of gender in Korea; (c) practice and hone critical analytical skills; and (d) present complex ideas in a persuasive and organized manner. Course materials are drawn from primary sources in modern Korean fiction and film and critical essays in gender studies, film criticism, history, and sociology. Knowledge of Korean is not required: all class materials will be in English (and translation)."
ADVANCED DEBATE WORKSHOP ,"Public Speech and Debate are at the heart of effective communication. They are 
central to democratic citizenship and personal responsibility in a free 
community. Persuasion is crucial to effective leadership, in government, in 
business, and in society more generally. This course will enable engaged and 
committed students to become genuinely impressive oral communicators who are 
capable of constructing rigorously argued speeches that are persuasive and 
successful in presenting a clear and compelling case. By the end of the 
course, students should have attained a level of confidence and achievement in 
public speaking to enable them to compete in international standard debate 
tournaments."
TOPICS IN POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES ,"Worlding Postcolonial Literature

This course focuses on “world literatures” produced within the context of colonialism and decolonization. While much has been written under the rubric of “postcolonialism,” the term remains diffuse and nebulous. The very variety of colonial regimes not only confounds a singular definition but produces a multiplicity of postcolonial experiences. How, then, does “postcolonial literature” engage us in more “worldly” ways of knowing, thinking, writing, and living? How does it call us into uncomfortable conversation so as to exemplify, complicate or refashion the category of “postcolonialism”?

We will read a broad selection of texts from multiple locations--Nigeria, South Africa, Jamaica, India, Chile, and Korea--to contemplate how colonialisms have shaped--and continue to shape--the “global” and “transnational” world in which we live today. We will engage with the major issues confronting the field of postcolonial studies: language and identity, nationalism and transnationalism, local and global, hybridity and authenticity, race and representation, gender and sexuality, colonialism, decolonization, and neocolonialism, and resistance and agency.

This course aims for students to: (a) become familiar with key ideas and concepts in postcolonial studies; (b) engage in interdisciplinary approaches to yield multiple perspectives; (c) develop critical reading and writing skills by engaging with a variety of scholarly work; (d) present complex ideas in a persuasive and organized manner; (e) enjoy reading!"
STUDIES IN ANGLOPHONE LITERATURE ,"Twentieth Century Anglophone Literature 

This course will deal with twentieth-century writings in English from outside the United States and
England. In reading the literature, we will consider how the writings engage in critical dialogues with
texts from the metropole (England and America). Some of the important movements and themes addressed 
will be modernism, cosmopolitanism, planetarity, transnationalism, colonialism, and creolity."
SHINHAN SEMINAR: HISTORY ,"Course Coordinator: helenlee@yonsei.ac.kr, Thursdays 1:30-3:00pm and by appointment"
KOREAN AND JAPANESE LITERATURE FROM THE COLONIAL PERIOD ,"The goal of this course is to explore the relation between Korean and Japanese 
modern literature during the colonial period. To that end, we are 
going to read and analyze some modern writer`s works from Korea and Japan. The 
questions as to how much Korean literature has been `influenced` by Japan, how 
much Korean literature has `imitated` Japanese literature, and/or how much 
Korean and Japanese literature are the same or different, are not critical 
matters in this class. Instead, we will focus on the questions of how colonial 
cultural circumstances influenced the formation of Korean modern literature, 
and what the result was. Thus, we will attempt to answer these questions by 
reading some representative writer`s works from the colonial period."
ASPECTS OF RHETORICAL CRITICISM ,"In this semester we are going to study Autobiographical Rhetoric under the general heading of Aspects of Rhetorical Criticism, 1) we are going to observe different rhetorical principles of the two classical models of the (male) autobiography: The ""Confessions"" by Augustine and Rousseau. 2) The next will be the so-called postmodern autobiographies by Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida. 3) And the last but not the least, as a sample of the contemporary female autobiography, The Cancer Journals by Audrey Lorde will complete our semester.     
   Then, we should first of all ask what is the autobiographical I. Is the autobiographical I is the real I? If the I is constructed, it must be directed by some rhetorical strategies to meet different aims of particular autobiographies. We will discuss this issue in the classical male autobiographies. Then, authors of the postmodern autobiography ask us whether it is the I`s voice or the other`s ear that corroborates the autobiographical stories. And they try to demonstrate that their identity shaped by the father`s name is deconstructed by their autobiographical memory of the mother who gave life to them. Lastly, the contemporary female autobiography is observed to utter a communal voice, providing itself not as a particular person`s confession, but as a testimony of certain traumatic conditions of life shared by them. Along with these issues, we can expect to explore a lot more of interesting rhetorical features of the autobiography throughout the semester."
ANGLO-AMERICAN LITERARY CINEMA ,"The beginnings of cinematic art are somewhat shabby. Originating in the early twentieth-century peep shows and nickelodeons, the cinema, was long kept at arm’s length by the literary academy. What is more, although a number of prominent American writers did try their hand at screenplay writing, their experience of the sometimes cavalier priorities of Hollywood did not enhance the artistic case for the literary film very far. Nonetheless, in spite of the commercial priorities of cinema, there has been a strong, if sometimes submerged, tradition of literary cinema. On this course, we will investigate both the US tradition and the British tradition. We will look at the relationship between the literary text and the filmic variant. On the first half of the course, A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962) and My Fair Lady (1964). On the second half of the course, we will look at Daisy Miller (1974), The House of Mirth (1996). The Great Gatsby (1974), and Blue Jasmine (2013)."
METROPOLITAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE ,"This course adopts an interdisciplinary approach, which combines literary criticism, history, and geography, to read those classical works with close 
connection to celebrated Western cities (and one work offering a fantasy of cities), from the classical era (Rome) through middle ages (Florence) to the modern period (London, Paris, New York, St Petersburg, and Venice). What we gain from this literary, historical, and topographical excursion, apart from enjoying a selection of some fascinating texts and gaining a greater intimacy with the cities they depict, is a critical self-knowledge of where and how we live, for the modern metropolis is where we live, loving and hating it, but never quite able to be free from its domination."
19세기 영국소설 (2) ,"At the end of the nineteenth century, the declining years of the Victorian era saw the outpouring of a creative freedom that rebelled against the morality of the preceding generation. Writers, artists, and critics challenged the boundaries of given understandings of sexuality, technology, and art. Known as “decadents” or “aesthetes,” many of these creative thinkers of the last two decades of the Victorian era explored homosexuality, scientific understandings of the human body, Empire and the detective form, and Gothic doublings of the self and Other. This course investigates the literary, artistic, and cultural climate that constitute “turn-of-the century” England, and examines the worlds of art, publishing, law, and literature that defined this time period."
LITERATURE AND FILM IN MODERN CHINA ,"A solid survey of Chinese literature and film in the modern and contemporary contexts (1919-2010). Students are expected to comprehend the Chinese culture and society through the representations of writers and directors. This class will follow a basically chronological outline while exploring differing regions of China: the May Fourth literature from 1919 to 1949, then mainland China during the Cultural Revolution and Taiwan in the middle of martial law. After the 1980s, writing and films will be situated in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, the lift of the martial law in Taiwan, and the transitions made in Hong Kong."
VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE ,"all students, but preferably juniors and seniors with some background 
knowledge of English literature"
REALISM IN THE REAL WORLD ,"This course is designed to develop a deep appreciation for all aspects of Neorealist theory (primarily but not exclusively the theory of Kenneth Waltz) by studying how the theoretical concepts relate to real world questions that are of interest to the class. After 3 initial lectures by the professor, EVERY aspect of the class will be handled by the students themselves. The professor`s role will be limited as much as possible to providing feedback outside of the class discussion."
신경과학:뇌과학 ,"The purpose of this class is to provide a systematic introduction to the 
mammalian nervous system, emphasizing the structural and functional 
organization and to expose students to the field of neuroscience. This course 
begins with the study of nerve cells: their structure, the propagation of 
nerve impulses and transfer of information between nerve cells, 
neurotransmitters. Then we move to brain circuit which control sensory 
perception, vigilance, emotion, learning and memory."
바이러스와숙주 ,Junior and Senior students
POLITICS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE ,"Why do countries trade? Why do they create trade-promoting institutions? Which citizens support or oppose international trade?

ETHICS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGY ,"In the past few decades technology and science have fundamentally altered our life: from the most private space to the public space; from the way we work to how to communicate (cell phone. internet..etc.) to how to engage wars.  We have come to the realization that these modern technologies have not been without controversy, and many science and technology have sparked intense debates that are often polarized or embroiled in scientific ambiguities or dishonest demagoguery. 
The notion of emerging technology does not necessarily mean that all such advances are new or revolutionary by themselves. These technologies (AI, the digital genome, CRIPR, GMO,Robots,..etc.  ) are now transitioning to a new phase, however, becoming more widely used or incorporated in consumer goods; these technologies are bound to gain more ground in coming years. The emerging technologies of the future will redefine our understanding of biology, the material world and manufacturing. The implications will further extend into geopolitics and global balances of power. 
We must welcome innovation and the benefits it brings us. But we must also remain committed to sustainable development, taking into account issues of inequality, human dignity and inclusiveness.  Embracing coherent ethical guideline is essential for building inclusive knowledge society and raising awareness about the ethical aspects and principles is central for upholding the fundamental values of freedom and equality, solidarity, tolerance and shared responsibility. Therefore, this course aims to articulate how we approach the regulation of emerging technologies will inevitably have wide implications - not only for security and ethics but for our definition of human dignity and the equality of individual."
과학기술의정치경제 ,"과학기술은 흔히 과학자나 공학자의 영역이라고 생각되지만, 과학기술에는 매우 복잡한 정치경제적 측면이 존재한다. 즉 사회의 모든 영역이 과학기술의 영향을 받기 때문에 심지어 과학기술과 상관없다고 생각되는 음악조차 그 정치경제적 영향력에서 자유롭지 않다.본 과목은 이러한 인식을 바탕으로 사회 주요 영역에 영향을 미치는 과학기술의 정치경제적 영향을 논리적으로 분석하고 그 이해를 심화하는 것을 목적으로 한다.

This course is expected to deepen your understanding of politics of science and technology. Politics is the process of making decisions that apply to members of a group. It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance?organized control over a human community, particularly a state. 
In modern nation states, people have formed political parties to represent their ideas. They agree to take the same position on many issues, and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders. An election is usually a competition between different parties.

A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one`s own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.

It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato`s Republic, Aristotle`s Politics and the works of Confucius."
KOREA'S DIPLOMACY ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ,"The purpose of this course is to examine South Korea’s strategic and diplomatic capacities in the field of international cooperation on sustainable development.

INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS: CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES ,"This course is intended to be an introduction to the idea of human rights. The objective will be to develop a critical understanding of the major 
issues surrounding human rights, as well as the intellectual roots of the modern-day concept of human right.  The focus will be more on 
the philosophical and historical aspects of human rights, rather than on the institutional features of international human rights law.  The justification 
for this approach is the conviction that a firm grasp of the historical and theoretical issues will provide a better foundation for understanding the 
contemporary legal issues and debates.  
The course will be divided into two equal parts, which roughly correspond to the two components of the idea of “human rights.”  The first part (dealing with the ""human"" part) will examine the historical development of the concept of human rights. The underlying theme will be: Who counts as a human being?  We will study some of the ancient, medieval, and early modern intellectual traditions that contributed to the modern conception of human rights.   In the second part (dealing with the ""rights"" part) we will cover some of the current theoretical controversies surrounding human rights, which will be useful for understanding the modern practice of human rights. Here, the underlying theme will be: What does it mean to have a right?"

CONTEXT MAPPING: INTERACTION MODEL FOR GAME DESIGN ,"“Designing Playable Cities : Game Design in the Urban Context”
Context mapping is a qualitative design research approach that invites 
contextually aggregated data, owners of the data, and actors to innovative 
design spaces. It has originally evolved for designing and developing 
innovative products and services in a co-creative design process, while 
it critically focuses on user experiences embedded in the everyday life. 
The approach is seamlessly linked to the idea of the living lab, the 
emerging new research technique for designing IoT. By the generative 
techniques of context mapping, we could facilitate a living lab setting more 
relevant and organic.
 
In the 2019 fall semester, Context mapping class will look into the field 
of urban digital experience that is effectively conceptualized by game 
design technologies, and social interaction frameworks. The prior 
knowledge on the game engine, Unity and c# programming language are 
essentially positive to comprehend the coursework and homework, but not 
necessarily prerequisite."

The students are provided with working examples for both Automation and Control through with they can implement and modify. The student is then free to customize the technology to accommodate their final project."
"AS LHP: SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN MODERN JAPAN, 1868-1960 ","This course explores social movements in modern Japan from the outset of the Meiji Restoration (1868) to the present, focusing on large-scale collective protests against political and corporate institutions over a variety of issues pertaining to communal, national, and international problems. 
Today, as we recently saw from new forms of protest elsewhere in the world, social movements can be shaped by popular media and cultural expressions, and are not dependent upon the involvement of conspicuous leading organizations. In response, commentators of a variety of political positions have sought to assess the (in)significance and (in)effectiveness of the protests. Inspired by these new features and recurring narrative constructions, this course pays specific attention to the cultural aspects of the social movements in modern Japanese history. I have designed this course to: 1) examine narratives of specific social
movements often differently constructed by the participants and historians, and 2) reinterpret specific strategies, messages, and cultural expressions in light of the recent experiences of the social movements.
Specifically, the course examines the ways in which issues and ideologies were expressed through, interacted with, and perhaps occasionally contradicted, various forms of arts, media narratives, and means of network formations. Rather than strictly following the chronology of events, the course underscores themes and problems manifest in specific social movements at certain historical moment. In addition to participation in lectures and discussions, students are
expected to demonstrate skills in effective historical research and cogently argumentative writing as well."
AS LHP: SPACE AND MOBILITY IN EARLY MODERN JAPAN 1603-1868 ,"This course explores Tokugawa Japan’s space and mobility??or phenomena broadly pertaining to performance, networking, and traveling??in society and culture from the 17th century to the 1868 Meiji Restoration. Over the past twenty years, studies of the Tokugawa period in the English language have sought to complicate the previous assumptions of the period as either years of authoritarian oppression, or, alternatively, culturally vibrant times yet to be transformed by Western modernity. Inspired by these recent studies, this course pays specific attention to how dynamic circulations of people, ideas, and things shaped and reshaped spaces (both lived and imagined), while often transcending or negotiating with the existing boundaries of geography, status, and other categories. By treating the Tokugawa period as a case study, this course is designed to: 1) identify problems with historical narratives (such as a history of development toward modernization), and 2) analyze historical texts of a specific society and community from the perspectives of space and its associated mobilities. 
The class covers the following topics: the 47 Ronin Story; the world of kabuki; homoerotic expressions; travel narratives; cultural space of protests; negotiations with Western Imperialism; and mobility in gendered space. In order to most effectively illuminate these topics and associated problems, Tuesday lecture supplements the assigned readings, and provides necessary historical and historiographical information and relevant visual materials. The general goal of the course is to provide students with multiple perspectives that will enable them to problematize the constructed nature of any historical narratives, and to facilitate methods of critical and imaginative reinterpretations of any society in the past and present."
DEMOCRACY IN SOUTH KOREA ,"Today, no one would deny that democracy has taken root in South Korea. But how democratic is South Korea’s state and civil society ? its institutions, labor market, social practices, and culture? What were the achievements and limits of the June Uprising (1987) that began the transition to democracy, and the Candlelight Revolution (2017) that brought a new government to power? The aim of this course is to get some sense of the thinking, sensibility, and affect of those who are/were active in social movements, to see how such movements, diverse as they were, broadened the ideological, political, and affective boundaries that were policed by authoritarian regimes, and to understand why social movements became institutionalized and yet remain contentious and defiant."
NORTH KOREAN HISTORY AND THOUGHT ,"This course aims to investigate North Korean history from the perspective of 
thought.  Over the duration of the semester, we will analyze major 
developments in the history of North Korea in relation to developments in the 
ideal realm.  As a result, this course is rather unique, offering perspectives 
and insights not easily found elsewhere, especially not in media portrayals of 
North Korea.  We will step beyond the superficial and tackle difficult topics, 
such as dialectical materialism, communist transition theory, and Marxist-
Leninist leadership rationalization.  This means that we will frequently leave 
the borders of the Korean peninsula in order to deepen our understanding of 
North Korean history.  This history, rather than being an isolated history, is 
a history tied to global history, and we will treat it as such.  Thus, you 
will also acquire a better knowledge about the thought of Hegel, Marx, Lenin, 
Stalin, Khrushchev, Mao, and many others.  By the end of the course, you 
should have a good understanding of North Korean thought and its evolution, 
some of the major issues in the intellectual history of Communist regimes 
during the Cold War, and the relationship between North Korean history and 
global history."
ASIAN STUDIES RESEARCH SEMINAR ,"This seminar is designed for UIC sophomores, juniors, and seniors who wish to work on their own research project within a structured setting. Ideally, all students would have taken one or more Asian Studies courses prior to taking this seminar. After reading a common set of theoretical/theoretically informed texts in the first half of the course, each student will explore in depth a specific problem or topic she knows to be important for understanding (and transforming) contemporary life in Korea / East Asia. 

This semester, the readings speak to different but related practices: visuality, affect, gender identification, and subject formation. In the first part of the course we begin with a text that calls into question what we see. A photograph does not reflect reality; a photograph is an act of visual imagination. From this, the text prompts discussion of how images make claims to knowledge about certain people and localities (North Korea for example), and how the viewer comes to be constituted as a subject via a visual regime. Subsequent readings highlight critical approaches to practices of inclusion and exclusion around questions about family, race, and gender identity. Engagement with these texts is meant to provide, in the second half of the course, impetus and inspiration for individual research."
RELIGION AND CULTURE(1): EAST ASIAN RELIGION AND CULTURE  ,"Discussion and research on the major problems related to East Asian culture

STUDIES IN AMERICAN LITERATURE ,"Whiteness in American Literature

This course focuses on ""whiteness"" in American literature. twentieth-century African-African American literature. 
Much of the reading will be of African American literary figures, like W.E.B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison,
and Claudia Rankine, writers who have powerfully illuminated and contested the condition of whiteness in America, 
particularly the recourse to ignorance and innocence. At the same time, we will read some of the emergent, contemporary
discourse on whiteness and consider how it has been manifested in ""classic"" texts of American literature."

TOPICS IN LITERARY TRANSLATION ,"Korean Literary Translation

This course will teach the fundamentals of literary translation from Korean to 
English. A new work or works will be selected for translation each semester, 
but will always be drawn from one of the following genres: prose fiction, 
poetry, drama, and essay. These works are often laden with slang, dialect, 
colloquialisms, puns, and other items that require a high degree of both 
cultural understanding and finesse to move effectively from the original 
language into the target language. In addition, works will often be selected 
from the early part of the twentieth century, making historical knowledge and 
sensitivity also essential. This is one of the primary differences between 
literary translation and other fields of translation such as legal or 
technical, which often display a high degree of commonality across languages. 
The course will provide an admixture of theory and practice, but, since 
teaching students to produce tangible results in the form of excellent 
translations is the course’s primary goal, the actual practice of translation 
will be the primary focus. As such, a native or near-native command of the two 
languages is a prerequisite; this is not a language course, and students will 
be expected to be able to translate from the first week of class. During class 
meetings, following brief lectures by the professor, students will alternate 
presenting their work via overhead projector. The professor and the student’s 
peers will then critique the work, asking questions and offering comments. The 
professor will translate along with the students, providing a copy of his own 
work at the end of each class meeting as a benchmark. A polished, preferably 
publishable, version of each student’s work over the course of the semester 
will serve as the final course assignment."
TOPICS IN GERMAN IDEALISM ,"Hegel`s ""Phenomenology of Spirit,"" written in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, is widely regarded as one of the greatest works of philosophy.
In it Hegel attempts nothing less than to demonstrate the development of the different manifestations of ""spirit"" --- the ultimate principle of all being and knowledge---from the most simple all the way up to absolute spirit. While it is a challenging, and sometimes opaque, text, it is also tremendously 
rewarding, and remains, to this day, one of the most influential texts in the history of philosophy.
The aim of this class is to read through the Phenomenology of Spirit, slowly and carefully, gaining an appreciation for Hegel`s unique and powerful
philosophical approach."

MODERN KOREAN LITERATURE ,"This class will explore the major works of 20th and 21st century Korean short 
fiction. Particular emphasis will be placed on the interplay between 
historical situation and literary production."
READING COLONIAL KOREA THROUGH FICTION ,"The goal of this course is to gain a profound understanding of colonial Korea by reading Korean fiction from the era.
To that aim, we are going to read and analyze some representative works of fiction from the colonial period. 
We are exploring how Koreans established their culture and subjectivity under Japanese imperial rule."
MYTH AND CULTURE ,"We will begin with a brief consideration of what myths are and why they are 
relevant, followed by a survey of representative theories of mythology. Then 
we move on to read classical myths and the cultural elements that gave rise to 
particular myths. When we have examined some of the most significant classical 
myths, we will apply what we have learned in our analyses of ""modern"" myths, 
beginning with folktales and local legends."
FILM AND MUSIC (THE HISTORY OF OST) ,"First adopted by movie studios as a promotional scheme for new films, the film music came into public consciousness with the advent of so-called ""soundtrack albums"" in the late 1940s. These commercially available recordings were soon termed ""film score"" and (or) ""original motion picture soundtrack"" and eventually became an integral part of the film industry and also the music industry.

Not only does film music enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact for films, it also works as a perfect marketing tool to promote them, as most movie theme songs or soundtracks have been composed, produced, and recorded by some of the most prominent names in contemporary music. 

This course explores the aesthetics and the history of music in film. Following a loose chronology, we will discuss its history from various cultural, artistic and production perspectives. We will watch clips from early Hollywood films to the most current and discuss how music functions within films throughout history."
CONCEPTS OF HUMAN BEING ,"In this course we will be surveying conceptions and understandings of the human being and of human life across different religious and philosophical traditions, including more recent scientific accounts. We will consider classic discussions involving issues such as the body and the soul, the relationship of humans with the world, notions of time and history, freedom and determinism, gender, the tension between the society and the individual, human religiosity, human knowledge, human morality and the value of humans. For this purpose, we will make use of a selection of the greatest classic and modern texts, including literary and artistic works, and samples of popular discourses on the topics considered. The course aims at providing insights on implicit conceptions that underpin many contemporary discussions, discourses and narratives about different aspects of human existence."
INTRODUCTION TO CONFUCIANISM ,"A general survey of Confucianism in China. Includes basic Confucian texts such 
as ,  and , with emphasis on those religious and ethical doctrines most essential 
to the various Asian traditions. Cosmology and ethical vision of  
will also be discussed together with Confucianism. Knowledge of Asian 
languages not required."
CHINESE NARRATIVE: ARCHETYPES AND MASTERPIECES ,"A survey of Chinese narrative with its differing topical approaches: justice, history and fiction, romance, and the supernatural. Students are expected to comprehend the legacy of Chinese culture by examining its continuing articulations of archetypes and masterpieces. This class will explore diverse narrative forms across time and genre: from the Han dynasty inceptions of historical records to Lu Xun`s personal essays; from the Tang romance to the Ming-Qing vernacular fiction; from the musical theatre in the Yuan dynasty to the revolutionary model plays during the Cultural Revolution, and also to contemporary cinematic representations of those popular themes."
ROCK MUSIC AND AMERICAN IDENTITY ,"Rock and roll music, possibly the biggest cultural export of the United States in the 20th Century, is not just a music style. It is an attitude, spirit, social statement, and badge of identity that carries Zeitgeist of a certain era. 

Naturally, there is something about American rock and roll that distinguishes itself from the music from the other parts of the world. Whether it was Bob Dylan’s poetic approach, James Brown’s soulful cry, Bruce Springsteen’s blue collar spirit, or Michael Jackson’s breaking the color barrier on MTV, 
American rock and roll has always carried a unique American identity of some sort.

Following a loose chronology, this course aims to provide American rock and roll and its narrative history from social, cultural, political, and aesthetical standpoints. In order to examine American rock evolution, our discussions will involve musical elements, visual elements, lyrical contents, and social 
impact of major American rock artists of the last century."
TOPICS IN THE COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY ,"We will study the topics in the comparative philosophy of history and try to apply our knowledge gained to the proper understanding of contemporary Korean history for social innovation and solving social problems in contemporary Korean society. The major topics include the significance of struggle, rationality in history, materialist conception of history, the social system of capitalism, dialectics of Hegel, etc. The first two weeks of the class have been substituted by online lectures. Online lectures in the form of videos will be uploaded to the web page every Wednesday and Friday. This class is designated as a Social Innovation Certificate (SIC) course. The course contents and practices will be related to social innovation and solving social problems. The Institute of Higher Education Innovation (IHEI) may collect student assignments and course contents for further purpose. For more details regarding the SIC, please visit the IHEI`s website, http://ihei.yonsei.ac.kr."

Also, the instructor will help the students to enhance their knowledge about theories of macroeconomics, international trade and economic development by introducing the Korean and the other East Asian experiences. 

Upon reviewing major models of economic development, this course will examine the century-old economic development of Korea and East Asia. Most of the emphasis will be given to the period after the Second World War. Most of the lecture materials will be devoted to review the evolution of the Korean economy during the last several decades in comparison with other East Asian economies. Major characteristics as well as the most important policy changes of each decade will be explained. Also, more specific topics such as macroeconomic management, fiscal and monetary policy, role of financial market, firms and industrial policy, North Korean economy and unification issues, and social issues will be studied. In each subject, relevant theoretical backgrounds will be introduced. Also, international comparisons based on various sources of references will be made as much as possible to enhance the understanding of the lectures."

JAPAN'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ,"The aim of this course is to provide you with a basis for deepening your understanding of Japan`s place in the world. In the era of flux caused by the rising tide of protectionism, an emerging great power competition, and the surge of populism and nationalism on domestic front, it is important for Japan and its neighbors to know whether Japan can accommodate this transformation in a way that recuperates the postwar liberal international economic order and peace in Asia. With military spending near the top of the international standings, Japan holds the potential to alter the balance of power in Asia. A continuing allergy to discussing security policy within the domestic political arena has shifted to systematic reconsideration of Japan`s security policy. Similarly, the nation`s wealth has enabled it to play an important role in the maintenance of the system of liberal economic relations. Struggling to escape from its “lost two decades” of economic stagnation and population aging, Japan stands at a crossroads wondering whether it should continue its existing system or accelerate structural reforms. Combination of these developments means that, more than ever in the postwar period, the whole basis of Japanese foreign policy is being reformulated. 
How will Japan respond? Will it fundamentally rethink its security strategy? Will it play a leadership role in helping to sustain the liberal international order in the face of US-China strategic competition? These questions will be addressed in the class discussion."
INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS ,"The goal of this course is to help students understand the role that money and capital markets play in the business and global economic environment. We first review the structure of financial markets and discuss foundations of basic monetary theories. We then develop equilibrium theories to understand the behavior of key financial variables such as interest rate, stock price, and exchange rate, and their linkages with central bank monetary policy. The present course will also address current issues such as the effectiveness and characteristics of unconventional monetary policies and their spillover to open emerging economies."
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND GOVERNANCE ,"This course provides an introduction to the basic principles of public 
international law as it applies in our modern world. It will focus on how the 
governance of our global system is being shaped through international law and 
policy. We will analyze the interface of international law and governance 
through the prism of such issues as internal unrest, dispute resolution, 
climate change, globalization, development, terrorism, use of force, pirates, 
cyberlaw, torture, human rights, genocide, the United Nations, the World Bank 
and non-governmental organizations. Students are encouraged to follow global 
events during the course to enhance their understanding. What are the 
limitations of international law? How can it improve our world? How does it 
work and how should it work? Issues will be explored through interactive 
analysis of actual cases of international law."
ASEAN AND OCEANIA ,"This course is designed to introduce critical issues and dynamics of international relations in SEA since the end of World War II. Students are expected to understand regionalism and regional cooperation in SEA and identify how the ASEAN and its individual members have dealt with various issues and managed regional order and stability. In addition, this course seeks to understand how SEA copes with great power competition, for example by focusing on China`s BRI and Indo-Pacific Strategy of the U.S. 
Goals of this course are to understand:
- Introduction to SEA international relations
- Regionalism in SEA and ASEAN
- ASEAN and rising China
- ASEAN and the US/Japan
- ASEAN and Australia/New Zealand
- Issues regarding Mekong region and South China Sea
- Other issues"
COMPARATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS ,"This class will be an examination of the relationship between constitutions 
and “peoplehood.” We are accustomed to thinking that the people are the 
authors of constitutions. But when we ask who the people are, or where they 
came from, the answer will remain incomplete unless we take into account the 
role of the constitution in defining (even creating) the identity of the 
people. In some cases, the very act of making a constitution was also an act 
of defining who the people (really) are. In order to interrogate this puzzle, 
the class will start by probing into the status of the various “peoples” in 
whose name constitutions are made and enforced. This will first require an 
understanding of the terms constitution and constitutionalism. It will also 
involve a study of the concepts of popular sovereignty and representation in 
historical contexts. 
Since constitutions are typically made as a statement of the establishment of 
a new political order, we will next turn to the idea of political founding and 
see how constitutions figure in that process. This means asking questions like 
“If a new constitution is made, does that mean a new political community has 
come into being?” This will require an understanding of the relationship 
between constitutions and political continuity and change. Again, the 
underlying question is whether constitutions bring about a new people. 
Even after the act of political founding, or constitution-making, the identity 
of the people continues to be affected by the constitution. Sometimes, 
constitutions may set limits on political changes allowed within the political 
community. At other times, constitutions may embody a desire to bring about 
certain changes in the identity of the people. 
In sum, this course is designed to help students think critically about the 
constitution in relation to the political dynamics of the ""making of a people."""
POLITICS IN NORTHEAST ASIA ,See the attachment.
NORTH KOREAN HISTORY AND POLITICS ,"This course provides a broad overview of the political history of North Korea, paying equal attention to internal, domestic drivers of change as well as the external, geopolitical forces shaping the nation’s trajectory. 		Chronologically, we begin with the pre-history of the North Korean polity by looking at mid-19th century and early 20th century influences of Confucianism, colonialism, and communism. The bulk of the course examines elite politics and foreign relations during the Kim Il Sung era [r. 1945-1994] of Cold War “juche.” We then look at the succession to Kim Jong Il [r. 1994-2011] and his post-Cold War survival strategy of “military-first politics.” We conclude by considering how the Kim Jong Un era [r. 2012-2020] fits into the broader arc of North Korean history and politics. 
North Korean studies presents formidable epistemological challenges, therefore the class will have a heavy emphasis on methodology, in addition to learning the basic facts and interpretive debates. The first week is dedicated to methodology for the study of history and politics, and over the course of the semester, student research papers will be the springboard for discussions about historical method. Students will design an original research project on a topic of their choice, developing analytical skills, writing ability, and use of historical materials [from discovery to interpretation]."
AMERICA AND THE WORLD ,"Course Description: This course is designed to provide a broad historical as well as conceptual introduction of U.S. foreign policy and global perspective on it. Major events and doctrines, along with Asia policy, of each administration will be discussed in historical context. As such the course examines drivers, stakeholders and major institutions that determine the U.S. foreign policy decision-making process.  The class discussion will focus on persisting debates in the U.S. foreign policy tradition: isolationism vs internationalism, multilateralism vs unilateralism, idealism vs realism, promotion of democracy and human right vs non-interventionism and imperial overstretch."
GLOBAL FINANCE AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ,"This is an advanced-level UIC course and builds on the knowledge acquired in introductory financial accounting course. The primary objective of this course is to develop the financial framework to understand the relationship between corporate governance and corporate performance. The subject matter of this course is relatively technical and challenging since the real-life cases of shareholder activists in various sectors are examined.

Corporate governance has become a well-discussed and controversial subject in global financial market. In this course, among the individual elements of ESG, we will focus on G. The G, governance is the internal system of practices, controls and procedures a company adopts to govern itself, make value accretive decisions and meet the requirements of stakeholders. In this course, students learn key concepts and the latest issues regarding corporate governance. After reviewing the refreshing, hardheaded original shareholder letters of prominent activists such as Paul Singer (Elliott Management), Carl Icahn, and Daniel Loeb (Third Point), students conduct an independent financial analysis to evaluate the proposals. The real-life cases of shareholder activists expose the students to institutional and empirical facts of corporate governance.

An in-depth analysis of various activists’ cases in the US, Korea and Japan should provide practical advise of what works and what doesn’t. Your understanding of corporate governance will be improved through exposure to different types of cases. The course is not intended to focus on activists’ issues for social change. Rather, the real-life case studies are designed to equip students with conceptual and practical framework to assess potential opportunity for value creation.

Industry expert such as head of private equity funds will be invited to the class to share his/her experience."
GENETICS ,"The study of genetics focuses on understanding phenotypic variation and the 
mechanisms underlying inheritance.  The processes that participate in 
converting an individual’s genotype into the phenotypes displayed by that 
individual are of particular interest and importance.  In this course we will 
discuss the fundamental properties of genes and the various approaches to 
genetic analysis, as it is performed in several different model organisms.  
When applicable, we will discuss current examples of genetics issues that 
arise in the literature or in the media and link these examples to topics 
covered in class."
세포생명공학 ,"This course focuses on topics related to the processes and functions carried 
out during the lifetime of a cell.  Topics including the actin and microtubule 
cytoskeletons as well as molecular motor proteins and cell motility will be 
covered in detail.  We will also focus on cell-cell communication, signal 
transduction and cell signaling in the context of unicellular and 
multicellular organisms.  In addition, we will spend time discussing the cell 
cycle with an emphasis on the regulation of transitions between cell cycle 
stages.  Each process covered in class plays a role in some important aspect 
of cell physiology and we will touch on examples of defects in these systems 
that can lead to disease.  Each topic will include discussions of experimental 
strategies and laboratory techniques."
식품생화학 ,"Food biochemistry is concerned with the principles of biochemistry which un
underlie the structure and behavior of substance and matter in food. It pr
provides updated information on fundamental topics such as sugars, po
polysaccharide, lipids, proteins, colours, flavors, preservatives, enzyme, fu
functional foods, and dietary supplements. Each of these areas is directly re
related to the current effort of commercializing food products and adding new va
value to them. The successful application of this knowledge is ultimately es
essential to the development and growth of major aspects of food science, in
including production, processing, preservation, distribution, safety, and en
engineering and technology. 

This course provides a one-semester overview of the subject leaving out the 
complex microbial derivations which usually accompany the one-semester course.

국제기구론 ,"International Organizations (IOs) are becoming a popular subject of daily discussions and debates among scholars, policy makers, politicians, and concerned citizens as their roles ever grow in international relations. This course is designed to promote deeper understanding of IOs by studying various aspects of IOs: origins, structures, roles, politics and futures. To bridge theoretical underpinnings with substantive knowledge on IOs, the course is divided into two subsections.

Section 1 briefly introduces (or reviews) relevant theories of IR broadly, and theories of IOs/international cooperation more specifically. We explore how each theoretical orientation sees the state of international system (so-called “anarchy”) and explains creations and activities of IOs. We will theorize IOs both as outcomes of international cooperation and as tools for promoting international cooperation. Toward the end of this section, we will apply theories to make sense of creations and operations of various familiar international organizations, including the United Nations.

In section 2, we switch our attention to the most prominent international organization - the United Nations (UN). We trace the history of, dissect the structure of, and discuss various activities, problems and possible reforms of the UN. The course focuses on four broad themes: international security, economic development, human rights, and environmental problems in discussing the UN. We will also have some discussion on other, often UN associated IOs, such as the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the IMF."

US AND WORLD ,"This course explores the role of the United States in the world from its founding until the present day.  The first half of the course traces United States global policy from the American Revolution to superpower status in the 20th century and looks in detail at the United States role in East Asia and its relationships with China, Japan and the two Koreas.   In March and April, we will have four joint class sessions on these topics with students taking a similar course at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, with a special collaborative paper assignment focused on issues of mutual concern to South Korea and the United States.  Then, in the second half of the semester, we will take a thematic approach in examining numerous key issues and debates regarding the role of the United States in the world.  We also will situate United States global policy in the context of broader theoretical models that seek to explain the field of international relations.   We will examine ongoing events in the news, as developments emerge, and relate current issues and policy choices to lessons learned in the past.

근대자유주의영어원강 ,"It is commonly taken for granted that ""We the People"" are the ultimate fount of legal 
authority and political legitimacy in a democratic constitutional order. According to 
this credo, the people have such a sovereign power because they authored the constitution 
they live under. But who are those people, and what makes a constitution democratic? 
What does it mean to say that people`s authorship creates the ultimate authority in 
a given polity? Can a constitution be made in such a democratic way, and if so, in what 
sense and to what extent? This course seeks to answer these theoretical questions by 
revising democratic constitution-making experiences of postwar Japan and South Korea. 

The course consists of three parts. the first section will review various theoretical and 
conceptual perspectives on democratic constitution-making. Some of the salient themes 
for common discussion are: revolutions and constitutions, popular sovereignty and 
constituent power, constitutional identity, democratic boundary-setting, imposed 
constitutions and transitional justice. Using these concepts as our primary toolkit, 
we will proceed to explore histories and theories about the making of Japan`s ""Peace 
Constitution"" (1946) and Korea`s ""Founding Constitution"" (1948), respectively, in the 
second and third sections of his seminar. For Japan, our discussion will focus on, 
among others, Article 9 (""peace provision""), ""symbol emperor system,"" ""August Revolution 
theory,"" and equal protection of the law. For Korea, discussion topics will include the 
Economy Chapter, socioeconomic rights, lustration, legal continuity and nationality."

We will explore numerous case studies and crises that have tested and reshaped American leadership in the world:  the Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union and its satellites; the Korean War; the Cuban Missile Crisis; the Vietnam War; the collapse of Soviet Communism; tensions in the Middle East; civil war in the former Yugoslavia; the terrorist attacks of September, 11, 2001; the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; and policy dilemmas posed by issues such as nuclear proliferation and climate change.  We also will trace the roots of America’s rise to superpower status during the 20th century and assess the many challenges now facing the United States amid China’s rise in East Asia and heightened alarm about Islamic fundamentalism. 

Throughout the course, we will study how American responses to world affairs ? and American interactions with other governments and international institutions ? have evolved across generations.   We also will situate United States global policy in the context of broader theoretical models that seek to explain the field of international relations.   We will examine ongoing events in the news, as developments emerge, and relate current issues and policy choices to lessons learned in the past."
페미니스트정치이론 ,"This course is designed to analyze and discuss the ideas and arguments expressed in major feminist political theories. Specifically, it deals with the 
issues of sexual equality and sexual discrimination in the family, public and private spheres, moreover across the realms of the state, the market and 
civil society, and further in international or global politics. It proceeds with discussing analyses and debates in diverse strands of feminist theory in

SECURITY & THE MEDIA IN KOREA ,"South Korea has underwent various changes with regard to the correlations between national security and the media.  First, democratization in the 1990s invited many actors into the security policy making process by unveiling the realm of national security which had been regarded as the exclusive area for security preofessional.  Then, globalization and the Internet brought about post-Cold war social changes into South Korea while North Korea`s threat were still present. Last, the era of social media opened a way for various non-expert citizens and netizens to register their views and anti-governments themes on security. This course is designed to provide various theoretical and practical discussions on the correlations between national security and the media.  In particular, this course focuses on such issues as different frames by government and the media, secrets and leaks, news report and security, and the years-old debate between civil liberty and national security."
INTRODUCTION TO JUSTICE AND CIVIL LEADERSHIP ,"“You are sinking deep boreholes into vast terrain. We teach you how to dig. It’s up to you to connect those boreholes.’” Oxford Don

This course introduces the unique mission of the Justice and Civil Leadership (JCL) major: Explore the concept of ‘justice’ through its relationship to law, politics, philosophy, and economics, contemplate the connections among these fields, and apply them (theoretically and pragmatically) to contemporary issues. Law and philosophy shape our concept of justice, and approaches to politics and economics determine how we execute those concepts. Graduates can use this distinctive focus on `justice` to tackle social challenges.

The course syllabus lists the readings for each week. For each week, chapters/parts assigned from the class textbooks will be indicated after the heading “NOLO/ASPEN”. Students should complete the readings before each class to get the most out of each lecture/discussion."
INTRODUCTION TO LEGAL STUDIES ,"This course aims to provide you with basic information and analytic skills that are thought be required for your further legal studies, or, at least for living as a citizen of a civilized nation.

Throughout the course, we will explore various topics relating to law, including, among others, the following: What is law?; Why do we have to obey law?; Is law merely ""discovered"" by humans or created by humans?; Who makes law?; What kinds of laws exist around the world?; What are the most important and basic legal principles commonly found around the world?; What is a good law?; and, What is justice?. To find out the answers to these questions, we will explore a variety of different legal systems.

If you actively engage in this class, you will be able:  
-to develop a firm understanding of ‘the definition and role of the law’and ‘the role of different actors of the law’; 
-to develop a critical and analytical thinking skill; and,
-to develop a balanced and flexible view on the law which is not prejudiced by a certain specific legal system."
HUMAN RIGHTS: FOUNDATIONS AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES ,"Human rights are the foundations for political, social, and economic progress and a major social science topic in neo-internationalism. But: What are ‘human rights?’ What are ‘third-generation’ rights? How do ‘western’ and ‘non-western’ definitions differ? How have states promoted rights, domestically and internationally? Is the ‘western model’ of human rights declining? We consider these and related topics. 

Our approach is interdisciplinary, drawing on philosophy, politics, law, culture, and international relations, and we study historical and contemporary cases. The course’s interdisciplinary approach builds analytical competence, as students learn to integrate knowledge from diverse sources and identify policy options, preparing them for roles as social innovators in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors. The course accommodates students from all fields interested in human rights.

SEMINAR: SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND POLITICAL ACTION ,"Social movements are shaped by, and transform, nearly every facet of the domestic and international socio-political-economic world. They impact our everyday public policies, including gender, LGBTQ+, the disabled, political rights, and transnational justice. Tactics and goals may be radical or moderate. They may be pursued against authoritarian and democratic governments. Sometimes they succeed; sometimes they fail. 

This seminar course will expose students to a range of theoretical approaches for studying social movements and apply these theories to ‘real world’ case studies. We will consider commonalities and differences in these ‘real world’ cases. The course is organized around several key theories and questions:
Students will learn to (1) distinguish major theories and describe their strengths and weaknesses in explaining movements; (2) ask precise, insightful questions about theories and cases; and, (3) write analyses of social movements their choosing.  

We approach each topic, theoretically and empirically. I will introduce a topic, but we explore subjects primarily through discussion and student presentations. Throughout the course, students will present on their two required research papers, and the class will ask questions and offer input.  In the final weeks, students will present on their completed second, final research paper.

THE RISE OF MODERN SCIENCE ,"We are living in the world where science and technology drive crucial 
developments and changes. New findings and innovations in science and 
technology are promptly translated into our daily life. In addition, practice 
and advance of science and technology are always implemented in a social 
context. The life and information sciences have been and will be in the 
cutting edge of the development of modern technology and industry in 20th and 
21st centuries.
 
This course aims to understand the basic concepts of modern 
life science and related technologies and the contents of their recent development. In this course we will explore both 
scientific and cultural texts that contain terms with contemporary biology and 
genetics. We will also discuss about the leading-edge biotechnology and 
related social issues."
"MATERIAL WORLD AND HUMANS: MATERIALS, CONSUMPTION, SOCIETY, AND ENVIRONMENT ","This course deals with human-material relationship. 
The way we experience things and materials can hardly be considered raw or direct. We do not experience them “directly” as they are in their “natural states.” Nor do we experience them as they exist independently of our acting on them. Things and materials are thickly covered with complex and multiple meanings through institutional, cultural, and political processes. Thus, the “nature” of things and materials are as much determined by aesthetic, symbolic, economic, and ritualistic values as by their physical characteristics. And we constantly participate in those various processes of creating, changing, challenging, and negotiating the social meanings of things.
This course will explore themes such as social meanings of materiality, power relations involved in material culture, and the problem of agency and alienation manifested in human-material relations, with special focus on social mechanisms through which materials acquire and lose values. Also, we will discuss the new kinds of environmental disasters having emerged in the context of fundamental change in human-material relationship due to excessive production/consumption/disposal that was made possible in the fossil fuel economy. We will also discuss modern urban space and built-environment with specific focus on social and environmental implications."
POLITICS OF WASTE: ECOLOGY AND THE COMMONS ,"We are living in an age of mass waste. Disposability has recently increased dramatically to the extent that exceeds the earth’s ecological carrying capacity. This requires a new and critical conception of the value of the things. Does garbage represent the state of “value-zero”? How is this “valuelessness” defined? This course explores, first, social and institutional dynamics of attaching values to things (and detaching values from things), and the way for things to be systemically retreated from useful circulation. Secondly, this course deals with social systems of managing toxins and wastes, focusing on massive infrastructure and built environment especially in urban spaces. Thirdly, this course studies human relations affected by the production and disposal of waste, with special attention to the issues of inequity and injustice. This includes power relations and information asymmetry regarding toxic wastes. Finally, this course explores alternative ways of relating with things and wastes, which are ecologically sound and democratically accountable."

It covers a wide range of cognition (e.g., perception, attention, memory, language) that applies to our various living contexts and the workings of the human brain relevant to the cognition.  Throughout the semester, students will learn important concepts and issues regarding human cognition and brain, and how they are influenced by, changes in, or interacts with our living contexts.  My hope is that students will become more attentive to and observant of the ways of their living and be able to translate their observations into psychological terms and concepts by the end of the semester, and ultimately convert them to social policies. NOTE THAT THE COURSE WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY REMOTE LEARNING FOR TWO WEEKS IN THE EARLY SEMESTER DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK. GET READY FOR THE VIDEO-CONFERENCING PROGRAM (ZOOM) ON YOUR COMPUTER."

TECHNOLOGIES AND SOCIAL CHANGES IN A CONNECTED SOCIETY ,"We are at the beginning of a revolution that is fundamentally changing the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope and complexity, what we consider to be the fourth industrial revolution is unlike anything that humankind has experienced before. We have yet to grasp fully the speed and breadth of this new revolution. Consider the unlimited possibilities of having billions of people connected by mobile devices, giving rise to unprecedented processing power, storage capabilities and knowledge access. On the social front, a paradigm shift is underway in how we work and communicate.
There have been two big turning points in human history. The first was the Industrial Revolution, where machines replace muscle power. The second machine age is the time when machines are now able to take over a lot of cognitive tasks that humans can do. 
There are three characteristics in the second machine age. The first is an exponential improvement in computational power, communications technologies, data storage and even software. The second characteristic of this age is the digital nature of core technologies. An increasing number of industries have software at their core and, therefore, are characterized by their economics of digitation. The third characteristic is the combinatorial nature of innovation. Digital innovations can be combined and recombined to create even more value."
INTRODUCTION TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND COOPERATION ,"This course provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of sustainable development and requirements for the Major.  Students will learn about the interactions between physical ecology and economic development, and gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which they impact each other. Ecological constraints (climate, disease ecology, physical resources such as soils and energy sources, topography and transport conditions) significantly shape the patterns of economic development, demography, and wealth and poverty. At the same time, anthropogenic activities (farming, resource depletion, demographic stresses, and energy use) change the physical environment. 

Weekly discussions will explore the breadth of the major and the multidisciplinary nature of the scholarship to provide students with an understanding of economic development and its relation to nature`s processes. Guest speakers will share information about possible courses to take in the future and opportunities upon graduation."

by the development and functioning of intergovernmental organizations in the 
globalizing world.
 
Identifying diverse dimensions of contemporary globalization such as political, 
economic, cultural, ideological, and environmental, this course aims to help 
student understand ongoing issues, especially, in its economic and political 
dimensions. For the first half of semester, students will focus on the tension 
in economic globalization: Washington Consensus vs. Beijing Consensus. To 
understand this tension, students will investigate international organizations 
including the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), the World Bank (WB), New Development Bank (NDB) of BRICS, and Asian 
Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). For the second half of semester, this 
course will focus on security and human rights issues raised in political

Nations (UN),    the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM)"
INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT ,"Infrastructure (Transport, Energy, Water, etc) is often mentioned as a key to promote economic development and national growth. Most of developing countries are keen to build infrastructure for their economic development. This course will explore issues and problems in infrastructure development, the principles of infrastructure planning, construction and financing, to achieve the goal of sustainable development. Particularly transport and urban infrastructure will be focused, because urbanization and accessibility improvement are important issues for sustainable development. Empirical transport infrastructure project cases in developing countries will be discussed, and Korean cases will be examined as an example of relevant topics. Students will be participating in the discussion and debate on infrastructure related policies in order to develop their own balanced views on development strategies and measures."

This course connects the foundation of microeconomics with real-life household and firms’ decision-making on environmental issues. Students will be exposed to basic empirical techniques and the latest examples that identify and/or evaluate key environmental problems in development. 

The main goals of this course are to discuss the possible economic causes and consequences of environmental issues and to be cognizant of the various government and market-based solutions to environmental issues in development."
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ISSUES ON INEQUALITY ,"This course will survey questions and issues related to two topics: inequality and redistribution. What are sociopolitical causes of economic inequality? How do political institutions affect the structure and scope of wealth redistribution? Why do some countries have more generous welfare policies than others and are these measures effective in combating inequality?

This course will survey and discuss the politics of inequality and redistribution, focusing on both institutional incentives to implement redistribution, as well as the mechanisms and actors that affect government incentives and capabilities to redistribute. We will further study the different factors that affect and drive public demands for welfare expansion or retrenchment."
ORGANIZATION THEORY ,"This introductory course provides lectures on frameworks for understanding organizations and organizational processes. Organizations have been studied from the perspective of several social science disciplines, including psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology and political science. The field on which this course is based, organizational behavior, draws from all of these disciplines and applies the insights derived from the pertinent research. This course will introduce you to this research and ways to apply the knowledge to particular situations through your analysis and subsequent class discussion of case studies.

Learning Outcomes:

-Take a holistic approach to address issues facing an organization.

-Apply frameworks and theories to analyze situations in which organizations are undergoing change.

-Apply frameworks and theories to analyze tools and methods used to empower, inspire and hold accountable members of an organization.

-Identify and clearly define a problem/issue; analyze and question data and information in a rigorous manner.

-Form a personal perspective, framed by the debates on governance in Korea."
GLOBAL JUSTICE ,"Course Description:

Until the early 2000s, most theorists of justice have tacitly assumed the 
Westphalian sovereign state as the frame of their inquiry. Under the emerging 
social condition of “globality,” however, on many pressing issues of justice 
the appropriate frame does not coincide with the borders of any existing 
polity; nor does the set of stakeholders entitled to consideration coincide 
with any presently constituted citizenry. In such cases, some other frame is 
required. But which? In this course we will consider some alternative 
theoretical strategies for answering this question. Readings include such 
authors as Étienne Balibar, Charles Beitz, Seyla Benhabib, Nancy Feraser, Marth 
Nussbaum, Rainer Forst, Jürgen Habermas, David Held, Thomas Pogge, John Rawls, 
and Amartya Sen.





Course Objectives:



This course will enable students to:

1) Understand the relations between democracy and global justice

2) Critically examine the role of global justice in the 
global issues.

3) Develop  her/his  own  interest  in  a  particular  issue  or  theme  
pertinent  to the legal and political issues that global justice faces by 
conducting a presentation and writing two term papers (5 pages) based 
on individual research."
SENIOR RESEARCH SEMINAR IN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ,"Classical economic theory assumes that individuals are rational decision-makers. However, this is often not the case in the real world. Using findings from psychology, behavioral economics have provided evidence that people tend to exhibit different biases due to various issues (e.g. attitudes toward risk and uncertainty; attention and bandwidth; present bias; learning; trust).  
The purpose of this seminar is two-fold. First, the course covers how recent findings of behavioral economics are relevant for understanding development. Second, based on the discussion of the papers, students will explore research questions that incorporate behavioral aspects of development issues, such as education, health, the motivation of public servants, and the provision of public goods."

INTRODUCTION TO ASIAN STUDIES ,"In this gateway course to the Asian Studies major, we begin by examining how time and space came to be re-conceptualized in the context of 19th century Euro-American imperialism, and what this meant when the past came to be reimagined as linear, national history. In the mid-20th century, in an era of competing (and clashing) colonial empires, what ideas and institutions aimed to produce a sense of belonging, aspiration, and sacrifice? To what extent were these carried over to the postcolonial period? In the final part of the course, we reflect on revolutions of the 20th century and postcolonial politics. What did Marxist-Leninist revolutions aim to achieve, and how might we understand the end of such revolutions? What are the contours of representations of the colonial past and neoliberal life choices that we encounter today? The overall aim of the course is to introduce students to critical scholarship in Asian Studies that shed light on the relationship between power and knowledge: how power/knowledge shape how and what we see, and the way we inhabit the world."

AS LHP: MODERN CHINA ,"This course examines Chinese history, culture, and politics from the late nineteenth to the first half of the twentieth century."
AS LHP: POSTWAR JAPAN: POLITICS AND CULTURE ,"After the 2011 Fukushima disaster, many scholars of Japanese studies began to reexamine the period understood as “postwar Japan” (sengo), seeking to make sense of the event and the subsequent revelation of the collapse of existing systems and values that had largely been shaped in the years after World War II. Inspired by such a recent intellectual current, this course explores historical narratives of Japan after WWII with a specific focus on politics and culture, broadly conceived. By closely examining a few representative works in the field, including John Dower’s Embracing Defeat and Norma Field’s In the Realm of a Dying Emperor, the course aims to provide a nuanced understanding of international and domestic political contestations in postwar Japan and their associated cultural practices and expressions. Students are expected to both critically engage with historical narratives produced in a specific ideological context and challenge their own assumptions of politics and culture in general."
TRANSNATIONAL EAST ASIAN CINEMAS ,This course examines representative works by East Asian auteurs.
AS LHP: CAPITALISM AND ITS CRITICS; KOREA 1920-PRESENT ,"How can you talk about the poor child without addressing the country that let her be so? It’s a relatively new way of thinking for me. I was raised to put all responsibility on the individual, on the bootstraps with which she ought pull herself up. But it’s the way of things that environment changes outcomes…  
-	Smarsh, Sarah. (2018) Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth. 

Capitalism need not lead to huge inequalities. But in almost all capitalist economies we see shocking levels of inequality in wealth and income. How and why does this happen? What are the consequences of such immense inequality - for democracy, individual life choices, and well-being? 

A compelling examination of these questions requires historical and international comparisons. We will look at wealth and income inequalities over time and across national boundaries, and we will listen to those who speak clearly and powerfully about the life and circumstances of the poor in the United States and South Korea. 

When we focus on South Korea, we must consider shifts in the post-WW II history of American empire, along with the violence of post-war South Korean history of developmentalism and neo-liberalism. We will consider how certain policies and practices allowed for increasing inequality as well as economic growth, and how those policies were justified & naturalized. We will end with consideration of how some neoliberal ideas may serve progressive ends. Background in economic theory is not necessary."
HISTORIOGRAPHY ON KOREA ,"Our reading will focus on social movements in South Korea. As historical study, our examination of different forms of activism and social protest begins with a study of martyrs (y?lsa) and martyrdom from the late Chos?n period to the present. We then look more closely at South Korea’s minjung movements of the 1970s and 1980s: of activists’ faith in history’s progress, and how the figure of the minjung came to stand as the national/revolutionary subject. In the second half of the course, we will examine two poles of the contemporary social movement field: right-wing activism of evangelical Christians, and feminist activism. As a study of historiography, our readings and discussion will pay attention to the ways in which these books and dissertations speak to knowledge production, meaning making, and mobilization in specific historical moments. Knowledge of contemporary (South) Korean history is helpful but not necessary. Conducted as a seminar, students will have to be actively engaged in classroom discussion."
FOOD AND CULTURE IN ASIA ,"This course is an anthropological exploration of food and culture in Asia. We will explore various socio-cultural aspects, as well as the historical contexts, of contemporary cuisine and food consumption in Asia. Food in different cultures represents more than subsistence patterns. A variety of foods and cuisine are often used as markers for identity, religion, class, gender and regionalism. A distinctive comparative approach will be employed to explore the commonalities, as well as distinctiveness, between food cultures and Asian societies."
MANGA: THE ILLUMINATED TEXT ,"This workshop course begins with the premise that the Manga is a form of 
illuminated text. From cave wall paintings, ancient Mayan and Egyptian 
hieroglyphics, and early religious texts to present day Manga (with forays 
into the Talmud, Blake, Beardsley and Apollinaire along the way) we will trace 
the development of literature with integral illustrative components while 
producing our own. In doing so, we will examine the connections between text 
and illustration from the pictorial embellishment of early religious texts to 
the introduction of text into modern and contemporary visual art, all the 
while reading widely and experimenting with the calligram, hypertext and 
collage."

"SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION AND POLICY ","New developments in all areas of science and technology have become deeply interwoven into all aspects of daily life and are among the most primary forces shaping the long-term trajectory of our social, economic, and political systems. The ability of nations to grow and prosper economically is dependent on their ability to harness the forces of technological change.  Today it is common to speak of the knowledge economy in which the success of firms depends on their ability to manage innovation and technological change.  Regions all aspire to be the next Silicon Valley and enact all kinds of policies to lure and support innovative firms.
There are expectations that the rapid acceleration of new technologies from emerging fields such as synthetic biology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and geoengineering has the potential to transform our world over the coming decades. Technological change pervades daily life, influencing nearly every decision. The goal of the class is to equip students to better understand the history, concepts, and institutions underpinning contemporary science, technology, and innovation policy. 

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Understand how various formal and informal institutional arrangements and public policy decisions influence entrepreneurial activity and innovation and how this, in its turn, affects economic efficiency and growth potential of nations

- Understand the changing relationships between government, academia, industry, and non-governmental organizations in regard to science, technology, and innovation policy.

- Understand the role that entrepreneurs play in the interrelationships between regulation and technological change 

- Form a personal perspective, framed by the debates on governance in Korea.

* Cases examining intellectual property rights, strategic trade, R&D promotion, and standards across a range of industries and countries will be analyzed."
INTRODUCTION TO CULTURE AND DESIGN MANAGEMENT ,"This course is a introduction course designed to acquaint students with the basic visual design vocabulary of line, form, value and color. Basic perceptual concepts such as figure/ground, pattern, grouping, symmetry and association will be dealt with initially. We will study value differences through the construction of the classic Itten/Bauhaus practice. 
No product, idea, service or technology ever gets commercialized without considering the market and local community needs.

지속가능한디자인 ,"Today there is an urgent need for radical changes in our production and 
consumption patterns so as to delink economic growth and environmental 
pressure and avoid catastrophic consequences. Given the capabilities of 
designers to imagine and create, the following question is raised: what can 
designers do for a more sustainable future? In this introductory course to 
design for sustainability (DfS), we critically examine the unsustainable 
culture of contemporary society, and explore the roles of design for more 
sustainable ones. 

The course offers a systemic overview of the environmental and social 
challenges that we face today, a series of dialog on our unsustainable culture 
and behaviour, ongoing efforts to change them particularly through design 
interventions, and a hands-on experience to design products, services, and 
systems that influence and shape sustainable production and consumption.

Sustainability is a transversal theme that goes across design domains. 
Students who have acquired basic knowledge about design for sustainability in 
this course would be able to apply it to various courses and projects. Most of 
all, it is anticipated that students will have an aptitude to practice design 
that cares for people and the planet.

particular emphasis on the short story. By studying different uses of point of 
view and the use of restrictive forms, ranging from the traditional to collage 
and the list form, students will experiment to revise existing stories-in-
progress and to expand their creative range. We will study various writers and 
learn by imitation, if desired."
FORMAL METHODS ,"Decisions are subject to normative assessment. Some decisions are good, others bad. When we face choices, we try to make good decisions. However, what does it mean for a 
decision to be good? This course examines good decision-making, understood as rational decision-making. The course has two components: 

1.	Decision theory
2.	Game theory

Core competencies: 
Critical and creative thinking: 50%
Quantitative thinking: 50%"
TOPICS IN MODERN KOREAN HISTORY ,"This course re-examines modern Korea (twentieth century to present times) through the lens of queerness.  Using the overarching keywords of history, culture, and activism, we will pay special attention to the expression of non-normative sexuality, gender variance, and atypical bodies or what today is referred to as L(esbian), G(ay), B(isexual), T(ransgender), I(ntersex) or “sexual minorities” in South Korea.  Though academic research, primary documents, visual materials, guest lectures, and media sources, we explore the lived experiences of LGBTI peoples, while recognizing the limits of accessing their identities. In addition to making marginalized peoples the object of our study, we will also use discourses and representations of queer bodies to capture various structures of power that have come dominate the lives of all Koreas, such as capitalism, militarism, imperialism, urbanization, sexism, and patriarchy.  By the end of the course, students will better understand the development of non-normative forms of sex, gender, and sexuality in modern Korea, ones that have tended to oscillate between obfuscation and hyper-visibility."
ADVANCED KOREAN ,"This is the first semester of advanced Korean, and is designed to advance students to greater strengths in oral communication competences and linguistic knowledge of Korean. Students will read selected texts related to daily life, society, culture, nature and other common topics. It aims to help students achieve high levels of proficiency not only in interpersonal but also in presentational communication."
TOPICS IN ECONOMICS ,"This lecture is designed to help students with understanding behavioral economics (BE). For this purpose, fundamental doctrines of neoclassical economics (NE) which are embedded in the postulate of rationality are reviewed. This lays the groundwork for introducing basic concepts of BE which casts doubts on rationality on the part of economic agents. These concepts include reference dependence, loss aversion, endowment effect, context specificity, framing, social preference. All these concepts are illustrated by field studies, statistical cases and lab experiments. In addition, some macroeconomic and financial issues are addressed. Lastly, policy implications are drawn from this examination, with the focus on libertarian paternalism, as advocated by BE. 
Throughout the class, comparison between NE and BE is highlighted.

*Textbooks

TOPICS IN ASIAN LITERATURE ,"This course examines early works of modern Korean literature (1900-1950) focusing on the longstanding rivalry between writers in Seoul and Pyongyang, the capital cities of two Koreas, and, more broadly, the Kyonggi region and P’yongan Province. We will challenge the presumed notion of Korean literature, which has been defined as “literary works written by Korean writers in the Korean script.” The rivalry between Pyongyang and Seoul poses a question of the writers’ identities, while early modern Korean literature complicates the problem of the definition of the Korean script. In other words, writers from the two regions often felt estranged from each other, and the early form of Korean written language differs from the present style of Korean writing. Thus, the first goal of this course is to grasp “which Korean” built the modern form of Korean literature and “which Korean script” was used. Following are the authors we will study: 

Ky?nggi-born authors: Yom Sangsop (1897-1963), Yi Sang (1910-1937), Pak T’aewon (1909-1986)

P’y?ngan-native authors: Yi Kwangsu (1892-1950), Kim Tongin (1900-1951), Kim Sowol (1902-1934), Paek Sok (1912-1996?), Ch’oe Myongik (1903-?), Kim Saryang (1914-1950), Yi Pomson (1920-1981)"
TOPICS IN SOCIAL HISTORY ,"** Course Descriptions ** This course aims to introduce UIC students to an essential array of topics that have been researched in the field of social history. Social history is an academic discipline that encompasses all material aspects of human life, such as historical change, economic development, political structure, social organization, human relationship, technological evolution, demographic change, regional geography and ethnography. It forms the groundwork for all types of historical research as it addresses the most basic yet indispensable aspects of human life, activity and organization. More specifically its sphere of influence as an academic discipline goes beyond the purview of the humanities, engaging with the most advanced terrains of research in the social sciences. 

** Course Goals ** The purpose of this course is to help students to navigate the field in the historical context of early modern England (circa 1500-1750), gain an in-depth understanding of the nature of the field and its various research agendas, and think critically about how the study of social history might speak to a twenty-first century audience."
LITERARY THEORY AND CRITICISM ,"This seminar will introduce students to the conceptual history of Western literary criticism and theory from antiquity to the present. Particular focus will be on classical criticism and Romanticism, which served as sources for much of twentieth-century literary criticism (semiotics, hermeneutics, poststructuralism). While the course will proceed chronologically we will be tracing some of the major concepts that have occupied literary theory and criticism from antiquity including: representation, aesthetics, myth, and the tragic. Throughout, we will study literature from various genres including lyric and elegies, novellas, fragments. We will approach these histories and theories from a critical lens: how has literary history in the Western Canon been constructed over the centuries, and how have such histories themselves become canonized? Students welcome to draw on non-Western primary sources for their presentations and papers. Depending on levels of difficulty, readings will be kept to 50-60 pages / week or less."
METHODS AND CONCEPT FOR THE STUDY OF HISTORY ,"** Course Descriptions ** This course aims to introduce UIC students to an essential array of concepts, ideas, and methods indispensable to the study of history. It explores a wide range of theoretical problems facing historians working on various time periods and geographical regions. What does it mean to think and write about the past? Is it a pursuit of truth or just an interpretation of something that is not present hic et nunc? Are these intellectual commitments one and the same? Or are they fundamentally different? What distinguishes the study of history from other disciplines in the humanities and the humanistic social sciences? Or, how and why does the study of history relate itself to other non-historical disciplines? How has the historical field evolved in the western academic world over the last decades or so, especially after the second World War (WWII)? This course will address these and other questions with special focus on what makes the study of history possible as an academic discipline. Before the midterm, we will engage with topics relating to the study of history, philosophy of history and historical epistemology, with focus on a collection of essays by Quentin Skinner. After the midterm, we will explore an important array of historiographies that have been developed over the past decades or so on both sides of the Atlantic: post-WWII debates in Holocaust historiographies, Annales school history, cultural history, microhistory, post-Braudellian intellectual history, and the history of reading or print. 

** Course Goals ** please see ""course requirements section"" below."
VISUAL CULTURE ,"This course is an introduction to the analysis of arts and visual culture in Korea. We live in a world full of cultured visual images. Although we learn how to read and write from young age, we rarely question the meanings of the sophisticated visual images surrounding us and also often take the images for granted. In this course, in order to “read” the images we live among and within, the students will learn some of the initial features of art and visual culture theory and concepts with special focus on the premodern art and modern contemporary art, public advertisements, popular culture and TV commercials produced in Korea. Through lectures and class discussions, students will learn to raise creative questions and interpretations about the given images and through visual analysis practices in all lectures and assignments, students will be able develop their critical thinking skills. Additionally, in order to gain an appreciation of the artwork and their inherent nuances, students will have one or two Saturday museum visits with the instructor replacing one or two in class sessions. However, please keep in mind that these museum visits may also be fully cancelled be replaced with online museum visits and will only be conducted IF the COVID-19 situation and guidelines allow us. 
By the end of the course students will be able to analyze the social role of images, how viewers create the cultural meaning and identify the power structures of looking and being seen in the contemporary Korean society."
TOPICS IN AESTHETICS ,"‘Aesthetics,’ though commonly associated with the pleasing or merely decorative, structure our perception, action, and conception of culture, nature, and reality. The word comes from Ancient Greek aesthesis and aisthetikos, signifying sensory perception, and was later adopted by the 18th-century German philosopher Alexander Baumgarten to study how we experience art and the beautiful systematically (?sthetik). In this course, will examine conceptions of the sensory concerning sound, touch, smell, vision, taste, and synesthesia, and how these have been central to the most innovative debates in fields such as philosophy, political theory, art history, and history of science. Historical focus will be on Ancient Greek philosophy and German philosophers in the period of the Enlightenment and Romanticism, foundational for these debates.  We will discuss affective, immersive aesthetics that have emerged with new, digital media, in which the five senses are less and less differentiated.  We will consider the increased interest in non-human aesthetics and the breakdown of sensory perception, whether in noise, disgust or the formless. Some leading questions include: what are the racial components of aesthetics? How might aesthetics be relevant to politics?  How do aesthetic experiences form (or alter) subjects?  Readings will be approximately 50-60 pages per week."
BRITISH AND IRISH HISTORY ,"In many ways the birth of the modern world can be traced back to the 
islands of the Atlantic Archipelago, whose extraordinary historical impact has been so strikingly out of 
proportion to their size geographically. We shall examine the historical 
evolution of the British Isles in the Early Modern Era (c. 1500 to c. 1800).  
This was the key period in shaping both the British Isles themselves and their 
connections with the world at large. We shall pay special attention to the 
relationships between English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh peoples and 
governments. A central theme will be tracing the emergence and refashioning of 
identities in the diverse territories of the British Isles across this seminal 
historical period in the emergence of the British state and empire.
Students who complete this course successfully should be able to describe the 
major trends in the history of the British Isles, including the interaction 
between England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, the development of local and 
national institutions of government, the evolution of language and literature, 
and the course of relations between the different territories and populations 
of the British Isles and the broader world.
Students will develop their research, writing, and oral presentation skills 
over the semester.  They will become familiar with the primary sources most 
commonly used by historians of the early modern British Isles, learn to 
distinguish them from secondary sources, and develop their ability to analyze 
both types of sources in constructing persuasive historical arguments."
TWENTIETH-CENTURY PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE ,"This course will provide a high-level introduction to important issues within 
contemporary philosophy of science. These include such fundamental questions 
as: What is science? How does it differ from other domains of enquiry? What 
are the methods by which scientific claims are derived and justified? Does 
science provide a true description of the world? Critically engaging with 
these questions will help you develop several important intellectual skills, 
including the ability to comprehend and analyze difficult ideas, to reason 
responsibly towards formulating your own considered judgments, and to argue 
convincingly for these.

Teaching method: 100% online (see YSCEC notices)
Assessments: midterm and final papers."
TOPICS IN CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY ,"Widely regarded as one of the most important French philosophers of the second half of the twentieth century, Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard (1924-1998) is known, above all, for his account of postmodernism in his book The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge, where he argued against the need for universalizing “metanarratives.”  The aim of this course is to study the thought of Lyotard, focusing on three texts: The Libidal Economy, The Postmodern Condition, and The Differend.  

The course will be conducted via zoom. Zoom invitations will be posted via yscec,
You will be asked to turn on your video feed during the class, but please be aware that capturing or transmitting the image of instructors and students is a severe infringement of portrait right."
HISTORY AND FICTION ,"During his life, the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-94) lived and travelled in Britain, the Netherlands, France, Germany, the United States, and lastly the islands of the South Pacific. In the process, he wrote essays, poems, short stories, novels, travel letters and many private letters. During an age of great political, social and intellectual upheaval, scholars have found references in Stevenson’s work to subjects as varied as religious crisis, industrial progress, scientific innovation, and imperialism. 

In this class, we will explore the real and imaginary worlds that Stevenson occupied. We will read a wide selection of his fiction including such major works as the gothic horror, `Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde`, the historical adventure `Kidnapped`, and the existential thriller, `The Ebb-Tide`. As we read his work, we will discuss how it illuminates Stevenson’s time as well as ours. 

By taking this class, students will:

Gain an introduction to major themes in Stevenson’s writing.
Learn how to historically contextualize fiction.
Effectively engage the relationship between history and fiction."
"MASCULINITIES, MODERNITY, AND MEN ","Masculinities, Modernity, and Men:
From Samurai Warriors and Salarymen of Japan to Beautiful Boys and Grass-Eating Men of 
South Korea, the archetype of masculinity have changed over time.  This course 
examines public discourses and media projections of masculinity, primarily in 
Japan and South Korea.  Focusing on shifting moments in history, we will 
explore how gendered social order comes into play and governs the way in which 
men perceive themselves or negotiate with projected images.  Some of the 
primary social sites that we will pay attention to are sexuality, military, 
and popular culture."
LITERATURE AND PEDAGOGY ,"Literature and Pedagogy: Close Reading and Beyond

This seminar will offer an overview of the history of (English) literature pedagogy in the twentieth-century (and twenty-first), 
allowing us to consider some of the fundamental questions and assumptions that have informed and determined the teaching of 
literature at universities. By rehearsing this history, it is my hope that we gain a finer understanding of the ways in which pedagogic 
and scholarly practice exist in a mutually constitutive relationship, while also revealing some of the stakes of literature pedagogy in 
terms of forming and socializing students in a certain image. To this end, we will conclude the course by thinking through the 
implications of many of these issues for UIC and its students."
ADVANCED STUDIES IN FICTION AND PROSE ,"Introduction to North Korean History and Culture

The goal of this course is to impart basic knowledge of North Korean culture, particularly its literature and film. To that end, this course examines the North Korean regime’s insistence that songs, plays, and folktales produced by Kim Il Sung’s anti-Japanese guerrilla unit―its leader, members, and supporters―during the Japanese occupation of Korea were the matrix of North Korean literature and art. Anything other than the art influenced by the first North Korean leader’s military achievement in the 1930s has been denied or underestimated in discussions of the roots of North Korean art. By examining North Korean theories and re-examining different aspects of North Korean culture, this course will provide a new perspective on North Korean literature and film. After an introduction to the history and the function of North Korean literature and film, the course will explore two topics: the long-term
the debate over the roots of North Korean literature (Sections B, C, and D); and the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il’s role in the formation of North Korea’s national literature and film from the late 1960s until his death in 2011 (Sections E and F). All students are expected to participate in class discussions each week. Visual materials and literary texts relate to different themes; secondary readings and more general theoretical texts from a variety of academic disciplines will enrich our discussion. The main subjects of this course are a North Korean film The Flower Girl (1972); and two North Korean novels: The Year 1932 (1973) and Revolutionary Aurora (1973); all of which were produced under Kim Jong Il’s direction."
TOPICS IN ASIAN ART ,"The subtitle for this course is Words, Images, and Confucian Ideologies in Premodern Korea. This course examines premodern Korean art history from the perspective of gender studies. We will study how gender roles and identities were socially constructed and how concepts relating to gender have been continuously reconstituted throughout the Joseon dynasty. Students will learn about the political, social, and cultural changes based on the Confucian social values and how it affected the representation of Joseon men and women through words and images. Throughout the course we will see various genres of paintings and discuss the didactic role of art in propagating the Confucian ideologies in Joseon. Each lecture will present images of the artifacts and students must be prepared to use the required readings to discuss the objects within their philosophical, social, and cultural context. Additionally, in order to gain an appreciation of the artwork and their inherent nuances, students will have one or two Saturday museum visits with the instructor replacing one or two in class sessions. However, please keep in mind that these museum visits may also be fully cancelled be replaced with online museum visits and will only be conducted IF the COVID-19 situation and guidelines allow us. 
 By the end of the course, students will be able to convey their thoughts about art using various analytical tools and learn to express their ideas effectively both verbally and in writings."
TOPICS IN MODERNISM ,"The Black Atlantic:

This course will be concerned with literary and theoretical texts by modernist
figures from the Black Atlantic, which encompasses Africa, Western Europe,
the Caribbean, and the Americas. In particular, we will examine the transnational
flows that have moved in various directions across the Atlantic Ocean, from the slave
trade to twentieth-century decolonization and globalization."
TOPICS IN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY ,"The history of nineteenth-century Britain is a key battleground in debates about whether or not Western society has become secular. Those who believe that secularization inevitably accompanies modernity argue that processes of industrialization and democratization led inevitably to the decline of British religious belief in the later nineteenth century. But how accurate is this claim? How, for example did British people view the relationship between religious belief and scientific and technological development? What was the response of theologians, philosophers, religious minded scientists, writers, and artists? And how far did religious thought in nineteenth-century Britain influence other parts of the world during the era of high imperialism? We will be exploring such questions in this class. Our responses will help us to better understand the debates around religious belief today. 

By taking this class, students will learn how to 

1. Create historical narratives about religion and modernity in nineteenth-century Britain
2. Evaluate conflicting historical interpretations 
3. Identify and describe historical trends 
4. Differentiate between what is important and what is inconsequential"
LIFE WRITING ,"One of the most popular genres of life writing in the twenty-first century has 
been the memoir. But the art or act of telling one’s story is a genre with a 
long history. This semester we will briefly study the history of life writing 
and explore the various forms of the genre, including the memoir, fiction, and 
poetry. You will have a chance to experiment with these genres and test the 
formal boundaries of life writing. The course will focus on writing as a way of 
discovering the self, mining the past and present, and examining?as well as 
recreating?one’s own life through nonfiction and fiction devices."

SENIOR THESIS: INDEPENDENT STUDY ,"This is a semester-long advanced research project carried out independently 
under the guidance of a adviser. It is especially recommended to those who 
intend to go on to graduate study. Some majors, such as Comparative Literature and Culture, allow you to do 
the thesis project directly through the major, but it is also possible for
students in all majors to do it through the common curriculum, either within 
or outside your major field of study. To do so, you have to register for UIC 
4801 SENIOR THESIS: AN INDEPENDENT STUDY. If you are considering this option, 
please read carefully the course description in the student handbook. Above 
all, you should keep in mind that you will be responsible for finding an 
adviser who will be willing to work with you. The faculty member should be a 
full-time professor at Yonsei. You may choose to work with a professor from 
either the common curriculum or the major curriculum."
100 YEARS OF HOLLYWOOD CINEMA ,"This course covers the history of Hollywood cinema of the last 100 years and examines its artistic content and contemporary cultural and social roles; ideally, it serves to develop your general intellectual capacities of the film industry. 

 Following a loose chronology, we`ll study the origin, development, and growth of Hollywood cinema from a variety of perspectives (e.g. social, cultural, global, technological and artistic standpoints) and discuss the evolution of specific trends, styles, and issues related to the Hollywood film industry. The course also outlines the history of the world cinema to illustrate its impact and influence on Hollywood and vice versa.  

By evaluating selected works that comprise each genre and a certain time period, not only do we trace the history of Hollywood cinema but its relationship to global popular culture, historical representation, and other mass media outlets, such as the music industry, TV, and advertising."
KOREANNESS ACROSS TIME AND SPACE ,"In this course we will be exploring the notions of ethnicity, cultural identity and its components through the examination of ""Koreanness"" or the Korean character across time and space. On the theoretical side, you will learn contrasting definitions and understandings of ethnicity and cultural identity, and explore their connection to related notions such as race, family, place and national citizenship. You will be able to review the multiple dimensions making up cultural identity and their context-dependency by examining characteristic Korean traits in the realm of politics, social organization, economic activity, social psychology and life cycle configuration in different historical periods, and by considering the changing narratives, motifs and meanings that sustain them. You will better comprehend the scope and limit of context-dependency by looking into ongoing processes of hybridity, differentiation or identification taking place among members of Korean communities abroad. A special attention will be paid to the influence of the economic and cultural expansion of the country of origin on the ethnic identification of these communities."
CROSS-CULTURAL INTERACTIONS ,"In this course you will be exploring the dynamics of cross-cultural interaction in past times and in the contemporary world through the examination of theoretical and empirical aspects of cultural encounters and cross-cultural experience. Course material will consist of a selection of academic texts on the topic, together with historical texts or first-hand sources such as narratives taken from early travel literature, missionary writings, sojourners` diaries, migrant narratives and cross-cultural documentaries.
The goals are both practical and theoretical: 
1. On the one hand, the consideration of specific cases of cultural interaction at the micro level will allow you to broaden your historical-empirical knowledge and understanding of cross-culturalism.
2. On the other hand, through systematic analysis and discussion of the texts proposed, you will be encouraged to: 
a) refine your literacy on issues related to cultural difference, similarity, influence, change and coexistence
b) identify patterns of cultural interaction
c) put existing macro level concepts, categories and theories on cross-cultural experience to the test."
THE BRITISH INVASION ,"Along with its rebellious philosophy and image, rock and roll music--arguably one of the first globally transmitted and accepted musical cultural products, became extremely popular with the British youth in the late 1950s. By the early `60s, the rock and pop music acts from the UK began to cross-over to American audience by throwing back rock `n` roll at America, hence creating the so-called ""British Invasion"" phenomenon. Even in the new millennium, the British Invasion still lingers on half a century later, either musically, culturally, or even socially. 

This course aims to provide the origin, development, and evolution of the British Invasion and highlight its significant performers and music styles to examine musical, cultural, and social impact and influence on contemporary society.

Beyond music, the British Invasion has expanded to cinema, fashion, and sports, and it has become more or less a badge of identity, pride, and legacy of the UK in one way or another. It will be an intriguing observation to approach this trend from a variety of perspectives."
KOREAN MODERNITY AND POPULAR CULTURE ,"Korea emerged as the site of political turmoil ever since World War II. As the only divided country in the world today, the nation has been and still is largely identified with political instability. Since East Asia has become a significant part of global economy and politics in the late 1980s and Korea became one of the most dynamic countries among the so-called “four Asian Tigers,” scholarly attention was given to the rapid industrialization and exceptional high growth in economy in Korea. Ever since the 1990s, however, scholars and critics in the field of Korean Studies have become interested in cultural production known as hallyu (Korean cultural wave). As the compressed modernity enabled modernization within just several decades after the Korean War, Korea has quickly turned from a society importing western cultures to a nation actively producing multiple contents in popular culture.

The purpose of this course is to understand modernity in Korean society and how the Korean modernity has affected production of Korean popular culture. Each week, we will examine how contemporary Korean literature, cinema, television drama, performing arts, K-pop industry, advertisement, sports, and government’s strategy of branding national image reflect sociopolitical dynamics of Korean modernity. By the end of the course, students will understand concepts of modernity and characteristics of Korean modernity in relation to contemporary Korean culture and society."
THE LITERATURE AND CULTURE OF DREAMS ,"From the ancient Greek and Chinese oracles and Taemong of Korea to the sofas of Freud and Jung to contemporary Yanomami shamans and Hollywood ""Dreamworks,"" 
throughout a vast array of cultures and eras, dreams have been a source of inspiration, healing and insight. In this course we aim to reconnect with the imaginative and 
therapeutic power of dreams primarily through writing our own, while reading extensively in dream literature.

Students will engage in extensive dream practice through composition and revision of weekly dream journals into literary art, study of and experimentation with a variety of diverse theoretical and practical approaches to dreams, and close reading of dream-based literary texts. 

Course goals:
1. Write with clarity and in detail.
2. Appreciate and compose works of literary art and illuminated texts derived from our dreams both alone and in collaboration.
3. Practice close reading and close listening through sensory engagement with a variety of written, audio and visual texts.
4. Begin to incorporate the regular practice of dreaming, recording dreams in writing (in the form of a dream journal) and reflecting upon dreams as an essential part of daily life.
5. Learn through reading, research and discussion about the function, importance of and approaches to dreams in a variety of diverse cultures and theoretical frameworks.
6. Experiment with various dream practices and techniques such as dream incubation, dream travel, and lucid dreaming.
7. Approach dreaming and waking life as a continuum."
THE CULTURAL ETHOS OF DEMOCRACY ,"This is a seminar on the political ethos of the West
and its main product: the democratic constitutional state. As a political 
ethos, democracy is based on a 
notion of common good that was developed throughout 
centuries of frequently troubled social and political processes, where trial, 
error and correction/adjustment played - and keeps playing - an important 
part. The seminar intends to highlight this dynamism and its cultural sources. Its aim is to  allow you to a) identify the core values that explain the 
political culture of western democracies; b) apply the resulting 
categories to gain a deeper insight into contemporary events, political 
trends and democracies in other parts of the world, employing - when relevant -
a comparative perspective. Some keywords are: ""civil society"", ""human 
rights"", ""crisis of democracy"", ""Confucianism"", ""democracy as procedure vs 
democracy as a values system"", ""ideology"", ""natural law"", ""political culture"""
영어성경과영문학 ,"** Course Descriptions ** The English-speaking cultures scattered all around the globe have been created by those who have read, honored, or at least carried the English Bible. The sacred Book was read as a literal and popular authority in Britain and its colonies on moral, spiritual, and existential questions of good and evil, self and society, life and death for some four centuries from the Reformation to World War II (and in parts of the U.S., even to this very moment). Yet it was in early modern Britain (circa 1500-1750), inter alia, that the Bible was regarded as the most central authority in the formation of public debates and intellectual cultures. The Book served as a foremost reference book for writers and statesmen on a wide range of earthly issues of law, politics, economics and science; they drew on the Book for a reservoir of wisdom and truth when faced with such questions as arising from the dialectics of fall and redemption, dominion and obedience/resistance, republic and monarchy, private property and land re(distribution) and even marriage and divorce. A close look at the ways in which they interpreted, appropriated, and summoned the Bible to frame their arguments via various literary genres can help to understand the importance of the Book in the intellectual heritage of English literature in the early modern period. Yet in this particular era, the Bible also stood behind some of the greatest monuments of English literature, some of whom, such as [The Pilgrim`s Progress], exercised a huge emotional and spiritual power over its readers supplementing or even competing with the Bible itself. This course explores and celebrates the unique importance of the English Bible, in particular, the King James Bible (King James Version, as it is called in the U.S.) by reading parts of the Bible and a select list of masterpieces of English literature that have close relationships to it. 

** Course Goals ** Please see ""course requirements section"" below."
COMPARATIVE ENGLISH LITERATURES ,"We live in times that seem increasingly apocalyptic. From our current pandemic, we look around us and see catastrophic climate change, systemic racism, food insecurity, and youth unemployment. Since the turn of the century, we have experienced 9/11, nuclear meltdowns, and financial crises. We live on a peninsula which is technically still at war, seven decades after a cease-fire armistice. In popular culture, we see these themes reflected in film and other media, ranging from the zombie apocalypse to AI cyborgs to futuristic interstellar journeys. In this course, we will explore the idea of the apocalypse/post-apocalypse in English literature through the ages. Our main reading will be a trio of powerful contemporary novels (Mitchell, Foer, Ozeki) that treat these topics within defining events of our generation. In between, we will take a step back into history, reading eighteenth and nineteenth century selections (Defoe, Malthus, Shelley, and Jefferies)."
근대성과신성한경험연구 ,"The goal of the course is to help you to strengthen your abilities to analyze and interpret literary and philosophical texts.The modern age is said to be antithetical to religious belief. The rise of scientific reason, the expansion of industry, and the emergence of bourgeois individualism are thought to be developments that have undermined the belief in religion. But even if religion has lost much of its influence over the modern mind, nevertheless, modern men and women still persist in treating certain experiences, beliefs, or ideas as sacred. Whether it is romantic passion, political revolt, or even murderous sacrifices, modern individuals have sought to undergo apotheosis, to raise themselves to the level of the gods. We will read literary and philosophical works that explore the persistence of the sacred in a secular time, focusing on the depiction of experiences that we do not recognize as religious that nevertheless involve a level of intensity that can only be called religious."
RELIGION AND CULTURE(1): EAST ASIAN RELIGION AND CULTURE ,"Discussion and research on the major problems related to East Asian culture 
and religion. Seminar topics alternate yearly with emphasis on Buddhism, 
Taoism or Confucianism. Comparative analysis of East Asian-Western religious 
and cultural thoughts will also be made.

(*Online classes will be conducted through YSCEC.)"
TRADITION AND POPULAR CULTURE IN ASIAN THEATER ,"Those who wish to read, research and study closely the intersections of language, culture, literature, history, philosophy, film, the body, ethnicity, gender roles, performance and 
martial arts."
후생경제학 ,"This course mainly focuses on economic analysis in terms of welfare. That is, we study how to evaluate the market allocations based on efficiency, how to achieve efficient allocations through the market, and when the market fails in achieving efficient allocations. First, we study market structure besides the competitive market such as standard monopoly (uniform pricing), monopoly behavior (price discrimination), and oligopoly (basic concepts in game theory are also covered). Second, we consider exchange, production, welfare, social choice (voting rules are mainly investigated), and externalities (If time allows). 

This course will emphasize the development of microeconomic models to analyze the economic decision-making of agents. Students will be able to learn the basic toolkit of microeconomic theory and prepare to take more advanced courses in economics."
게임이론과응용 ,"This course introduces students to the basic ideas and applications of game theory. This course begins with expected utility theory, and then introduces the fundamental ideas of game theory: strategic-form games, Nash equilibrium, games with incomplete information, extensive-form games, sequential equilibrium, repeated games, as well as games with communication."
경제발전론 ,"This course is designed for students who major in social science with proper background of economics.  In particular, the junior and senior students whose major/minor is economics would be the main target of this course.
This course will first introduce the nature and concept of economic development as well as some stylized facts of development.  It will also introduce several important theories and models of economic development.  The second part of the course will focus more on specific issues such as income distribution, population, human capital, development policy making, and international trade.  For each subject, empirical analysis and case studies will be provided to enhance the understanding of students.
Basically, this course will rely on lectures.  However, students are encouraged to join discussions and debate for each subject.  Also, students will form several groups, and each group will prepare for a presentation that will be made in the end of the semester. When time is allowed, one or two special lectures will be arranged with invited speakers.
This lecture will combine on-line and off-line lectures. The Monday lecture will be conducted in the classroom, and the Wednesday lecture will be replaced by on-line lecture. On-line lecture would be either real-time zoom lecture or pre-recorded video lecture. When we have real-time zoom lectures, students are supposed to join the lecture on time with their cameras on. Pre-recorded video lecture will be uploaded at yscec every Wednesday, and students are supposed to watch it by 11:55 pm in the same week. Questions with regard to on-line video lecture will be answered during the off-line lecture."
수리경제학 ,"This course aims to provide basic mathematical concepts that have been widely used in economics. The topics covered will include feasibility (Farkas Lemma), convex sets, linear programming, and non-linear programming. Economic applications will be discussed throughout the course in order to illustrate how mathematics is used in economic theory."

[Course overview]

Public Economics (also called Public Finance) studies various issues related to government activities. Governments collect taxes (revenue or taxation side) and spend them on a variety of areas in the economy (expenditure side). In this course, we will first discuss important issues in the expenditure side such as public goods and governments’ intervention in markets with externalities. Then, we will turn to the taxation side to address the effects of various taxes and social insurance programs and the optimal design of those policies. We will also analyze other important topics like government debts and the pension system if time permits."
계약및조직이론 ,"This is a course in contract theory and its applications. We will study some key tools relevant for studying various environments with asymmetric information, and discuss some applications in Industrial Organization and Labor Economics."
의료경제학 ,"This course introduces topics related to health economics. The relevant topics 
include nature of the commodity health care and the production of health; 
traditional and alternative theories of demand; economics of insurance and information; 
behavior of health care providers including physicians and hospitals; the technique 
of using economic evaluation in health care to set priorities. etc

개발경제특수문제 ,"This course is intended to provide an introduction to topics and concepts that are of relevance in the context of modern economic development. The focus of this unit is on applying tools in economics in analyzing important issues in development. The emphasis in the lectures will be on the methodology that one adopts to study key issues in the area of development. Throughout the course we will discuss methods for obtaining and analyzing the kinds of data needed for the testing of theory and the evaluation of policy interventions in development contexts.

The learning goals associated with this unit are to:
introduce students to rigorous economic analysis in studying key issues in development economics;
be familiar with the distinctive environmental, technical and social characteristics of developing countries;
understand the processes of structural and social change which occur during development;
recognize the importance of institutions, technological change, international aid, and investment for the development process; and
have skills necessary for the critical appraisal of theories of economic development.

On completion of the unit, the student should be able to demonstrate (a) confidence in applying relevant microeconomic techniques to key issues in developing countries; (b) an ability to use econometric and other methodologies to analyze data sets from developing countries to address key policy questions; and (c) an ability to critically read specialist articles in development economics."
INTRODUCTION TO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES ,"This course introduces students to the field of international studies, and 
serves as a foundation for coursework in the International Studies 
major. Students will gain familiarity with the core disciplines of 
international studies: ecology, world history, international relations, 
international economics & international political economy, international law 
and organizations, cultural studies, regional studies, negotiation and conflict resolution. Students will learn these 
various disciplines by analyzing writings by leading theorists as well as 
practitioners in the field.

As we learn the disciplines, we will also explore some of the key issues in 
contemporary (post-Cold War) international studies, such as: global public health and climate crises; the nature of 
historical change and waves of globalization; the dilemma of sovereignty 
and universality, 
and debate between realism vs. liberalism vs. constructivism in contemporary 
IR theory; the balance of state vs. market, especially in an era 
of global financial crises & transnational security challenges; new concepts 
of identity in an era of cosmopolitanism and resurgent nationalism. 

Toward the end of the semester, students will prepare a group mock 
negotiation, as a way to `practice` international conflict and cooperation."
THEORIES OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ,"Theory is the way we learn broad generalizable lessons about a field of study. Disciplines like history and area studies look at one specific time, place, or issue and try to understand that one thing in great detail; IR theory tries to find lessons, tendencies, and causal forces that can be applied to all/many cases. As such, learning theory is the quickest way for you make sense of new things that you will encounter in the future.
There are many theories in the field of IR, but the three main ones are neorealism, neoliberal institutionalism (NLI) and constructivism. We will spend the first half of the course discussing these fundamental approaches in detail - the theories themselves, but also the abstract and critical thinking skills that go into crafting and using theories. In the second half, students will make two team presentations: the first will be on a different theory, such as classical realism, feminism, critical theory, and so on. The second will be a case study in which students will choose a topic that interests them and see how ALL of our theories can be applied to that case."
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS ,"This course presents international trade theory and its application to current policy issues. Topics include labor productivity and comparative 
advantage, specific factors and income distribution, resources and trade, external economies of scale and the international location of production, 
firms in the global economy, the instruments of trade policy, and the political economy of trade."
CONTEMPORARY CHINESE POLITICS ,"This course is to examine the development and behavior of political institutions in China, specifically after the Communist takeover of power in 1949. The structure of this course is twofold: first, we will study the importance of leadership and how institutions have been shaped and reshaped over the years, with special attention to the tensions and challenges of development. Second, we will consider various issues of public policy and governance, including, but not limited to, the following issues: the role of the CCP, the relationship between Beijing and the provinces, state-society relations, and development and corruption. This course surveys various social and political issues in China from a comparative perspective and introduces different analytical concepts and approaches."
GLOBAL FINANCE AND INDUSTRY ,"The objective of Global Finance and Industry is to give you a broad understanding of the framework and evolution of key global industries such as automobile, information technology (smartphone, semiconductor and consumer electronics), consumer and Internet. The course will focus on industry fundamental drivers (demand, supply, pricing, capacity etc) as well as the major trends and challenges facing the key industries. Companies must contend with multiple challenges tied to regulators, legacy systems, disruptive technology, emerging competitors, and ever-demanding customers while pursuing strategies for sustainable growth.

The course will pursue both top-down sector overview and bottom-up individual company research on key players with the help of basic financial analytical tools. We will identify and learn the fundamental issues that the world’s leading companies are facing, which you can use in your post-UIC careers to evaluate future industry directions.

In the first half of the course, we will focus on developing analytical framework such as industry demand analysis and financial statements analysis. Throughout the course, we will examine many real-life cases such as Apple, Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor, Tesla, Starbucks, Nike, Google, Facebook and Amazon. Global auto industry and Hyundai Motor in particular will be examined thoroughly to understand industry/company competitive analysis."
EAST ASIAN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ,"This course was originally designed as a flipped classroom course in which students preview the assigned online lectures before discussion and debates. As COVID outbreaks are raging recently, class discussion will also be online via Zoom until midterm. After midterm, the class will follow the university guideline.  
	The theme of this course is to interrogate the complex nature of East Asian international order. There is an increased level of economic interdependence across the national economies in East Asia. Such interdependence shapes and constrains their foreign policies. But the ongoing power shift best characterized by a rising China and relatively declining the United States and Japan, is destabilizing the regional security system, often negatively affecting economic cooperation. Besides changes in material structure, East Asia is embedded in ideational structures that betray clashes of national identity on the one hand and emerging collective identities on the other. The contested interpretation of the past concerning traditional Chinese empire and modern Japanese colonialism have helped to create identity conflict, but at the same time counter-veiling forces have delimited the range of international tension. 
	We will closely look into the nature of East Asian international relations that blend and conflate the above three layers of regional characteristics, entering into the security-economic-identity nexus. Key theories and debates in the field of IR and IPE will be employed to examine the political, economic, and cultural contexts in which the region has evolved through the dynamics of division and integration."
PROBLEMS IN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ,This course is designed to provide with theoretical framework to understand the issues related to international security.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW ,"Study of international trade law will be supplemented by the basic 
understanding of the international trade theory and public policy goals. 
Relevant trade law cases will be introduced through out the course to aid 
students` understanding of international trade law."
MODERN CHINESE HISTORY ,"This course provides a foundational knowledge of modern Chinese history, and 
also poses the most fundamental questions about the meaning of China’s modern 
experience. With an emphasis on the intersection of intellectual and political 
history, where power and ideas converge, we rethink the grand narrative of 
China 
from the highpoint of the Qing Dynasty in 1800, to the lowpoint of Republican 
era warlordism and semi-colonialism in the 1930s, all the way through the 
extraordinary return of China to economic and political significance since the 
start of “reform and opening up” in the 1970s. 
The class will focus on a dozen seminal intellectual and political leaders who 
in many ways defined the course of modern Chinese history. We will study their 
changing diagnoses of China’s problem and their prescriptions for “saving” 
their country. In the last weeks of the class, we will look at how China is 
being transformed by the attainment of the constant goal of modern leaders—
wealth, power, and status, and, finally, consider the possibilities of what 
might come next."
CYBERSECURITY ,"This course is designed to introduce students to the wide range of 
opportunities and threats that have opened up with the advent of the 
information age. Students will come to understand holistically how 
cybersecurity connects to a wide range of issue areas in international 
relations (military, political, economic, etc.), and how the digitization of 
information leads to new vulnerabilities that traditional IR has 
never faced before. This will give students a head start when they inevitably 
have to deal with cyber-related issues throughout their careers.
DURING QUARANTINE, CLASS WILL CONSIST OF PRERECORDED LECTURES AND REAL-TIME CLASS DISCUSSIONS OF THAT MATERIAL. EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS GET THE SAME QUALITY EDUCATION AND CLASS INTERACTION AS A NORMAL SEMESTER, EVEN IF THEY ARE OVERSEAS."
EAST AND WEST: FUNDAMENTALS OF WORLD POLITICS ,"Is West West, and the East is East?  Are they separate and competitive or they are interrelated and interdependent?  Which world reins supreme?  How will the arrival of new global changes and challenges affect the dynamics between the two worlds?  We will examine this question by critically reviewing existing body of scholarly works in the field of international relations.  

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
- Stimulate critical analysis of current issues and debates in international relations
- Explore the historical, political and social foundations of contemporary global norms and practices
- Identify and discuss the problem of governance in international politics

*  It is important for you to keep abreast of recent issues by reading The New York Times, The Economist, and/or Financial Times, as well as other main media sources."
INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION ,"This course provides students opportunity to learn diplomacy and international negotiations in the context of international relations. The course consists of two parts. The first part focuses on history and importance of diplomacy and role of diplomat to resolve conflicts among the countries. 
The second part covers types and methods of how to make negotiation to achieve political and diplomatic goals based on their national interests.

Students also learn lessons from case studies of past and current international negotiations such as in the Cuban Missile Crisis, Iran and North Korean nuclear issues. In the case studies, students are recommended to make presentations possibly by representing a country which was involved in the process of such negotiations.
 
Professor Shin had served for long time as a Korean diplomat in the Foreign Ministry as well as in overseas Embassies and Missions at a number of countries and places. Utilizing his experience of practicing negotiations in bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, it is expected that students can have better understanding about real diplomatic activities and negotiations. During the course, Professor Shin would also like to share his ideas and views with students who might have interests in becoming diplomat (foreign service officer) or joining international organizations such as the United Nations(UN), IAEA(International Atomic Energy Agency) and others."
HISTORY OF KOREA-US RELATIONS ,"This course will provide a broad historical overview of Korean-American relations from the initial encounters in the 19th century to the postliberation period. There will be a particular focus on important developments during the height of the Cold War and the factors that have played a key role in shaping the Korea-US relations. The course requirements are one paper presentation and a 10-15 page research paper on any topic that is related to the course materials.

Note: this is a 100% online course but lectures will not be prerecorded. Online interface will be announced via email prior to the first class meeting."
MODERN KOREA-JAPAN RELATIONS ,"This course aims to give an introductory survey of Korean-Japanese relations, with special reference to the post-1945 period. Course discussions will touch on some of the major historical events, particularly the colonial period, but the focus will remain on the analysis of post-colonial affairs. The diplomatic normalization process is thus treated as on the the most important developments since Korea`s independence, linking the past and the present. Each country`s political culture, foreign policy decision-making, socio-economic background, and pertinent international relations will also be examined closely. The hope is for the students to acquire a sound understanding not only of this complex bilateral relations, but also of the dynamics of domestic political developments."
A NEW CONTEXT OF CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY ,"The major objective of this class is to help students understand the international behaviors of contemporary China. In particular, this course intends to review China’s contemporary diplomacy from two different angles: historical perspectives (before mid-term exam) and issue-analytical perspectives (after mid-tem exam)."
응용미생물학 ,"Applied Microbiology course covers bacterial genetics, microbial diversity and systematics, eukaryotic cell biology and eukaryotic microorganisms, metabolic diversity, basic immunology, host-pathogen interactions, industrial microbiology, and practical application of genetic engineering.

정치학개론 ,"사회과학도들에겐 사회를 바라보는 관점과 비판에 대한 근거(rationale) 의식이 필요하다. 과목의 목적은 정치학 (나아가 사회과학)의 기초적 내용과 논리를 소개함이다. 민주시민이 되기 위한 기본 내용을 소개한다. 현대를 사는 인간들에게 전공에 상관없이 보다 보편적인 가치와 철학체계, 그리고 이와 연결되어 진행되는 정치과정에 대한 소양이 필요하다. 다양한 정치현상들과 연관된 이론들을 기반으로 하여, 현대 사회의 주요한 이슈들(salient issues)을 현실과 이론의 조합 속에서 이해해 본다."
비교정치론 ,"정치현상을 국가간의 비교를 통해서 특수성과 보편성이란 차원을 구분하여 논의한다. 헌법, 정부형태, 선거정당의회, 정치경제 등에 나타난 국가간 제도들의 유사성과 상이성을 통해서 일반성과 특수성에 대한 논의를 진행한다. 제도와 문화에 나타난 주요 이슈들(분리와 통합, 지역 이슈들 등)을 비교관점에서 분석한다. 특히, 단순한 비판이 아닌 대안을 지닌 비판적 안목을 갖도록 한다."
INTRODUCTION TO KOREAN POLITICS & GOVERNMENT ,"The purpose of this course is to provide students with overall understanding of the politics in Korea. The Korean peninsula has geographic importance for politics in Northeast Asia for over a thousand years. Located between Japan and China, Korean domestic politics and international politics have never been clearly separated. Hence, the course will be attentive to the subtle interactions between internal political dynamics and shifting international power structures."
한국외교정책 ,"첫째, 국제정치(IP) 또는 국제관계(IR) 이론과 구별되는 외교정책론(FPA)의 학술적 접근과 모델의 내용들을 살펴보는 한편, 둘째, 외교정책이 결정되는 과정에 참여하는 주된 행위자들의 역할과 기능, 그리고 이들 행위자들이 기능하는 내용들의 긍정적 측면과 부정적 한계들을 분석하고, 셋째, 한국외교정책이 직면하고 있는 국내외의 환경과 그 환경의 지속 및 변화 양상을 고려하고, 넷째, 한국외교정책이 갖고 있는 차별적인 특성과 이러한 특성들이 반영된 차별적인 한국외교정책들을 분석하고 논의함으로서, 한국외교정책에 대한 학술적 이해와 분석력을 높이는데 목표가 있음."
한국국제정치사 ,"- 연세대학교의 교육이념인 진리와 자유(Veritas et libertas) 정신에 따라 교육. 
- 국제적으로 코리아라고 통칭되는 고려, 조선, 대한제국, 일제 하 조선과 대한민국 임시정부, 그리고 해방 이후 대한민국과 `조선민주주의인민공화국` 등은 모두 강력한 국제정치적 영향을 받는 지정학적 시공간 속에 존재해왔다. 이러한 지정학적 연속성 속에서 코리아, 조선/대한의 역사를 고찰함으로써 지정학적으로 존재하는 인간의 삶과 죽음에 직결될 수 있는 진실(veritas)을 탐구하고, 졸업 후 그러한 진실을 국내외적으로 전파할 수 있는 능력을 함양.
- 좌우를 초월하여 역사가 지닌 정치적 함의, 정치가 지닌 역사적 함의를 냉철하게 분석할 수 있는 역사정치학적 지성을 함양.
- 정치외교적 인간들은 어떻게 역사를 만들어 왔는가? 정치외교적 인간들은 역사를 통해 어떻게 만들어졌는가? 정치외교적 인간들은 역사를 어떻게 활용(오용)했는가? 정치외교적 인간들은 어떻게 역사에 기록되는가?"
한국정치사상 ,"이 강의는 조선시대 정치사의 주요 쟁점과 그것을 둘러싼 투쟁의 과정을 통시적으로 고찰하고 비판적으로 분석하는 데 목적을 두고 있다. 특히 조선의 정치사는 왕조의 역사이면서 동시에 지식인들의 역사였다는 점에서 왕권과 신권의 길항이 조선시대 전 기간에 걸쳐 점철되어 있었다. 따라서 본 강의에서는 이러한 왕권과 신권의 구조적 길항에 주목하면서, 그 갈등이 첨예하게 표출되었던 시기를 중심으로 조선시대의 정치사를 고찰한다."
국가와헌법 ,"1. 헌법은 국가의 통치조직과 통치작용의 원칙을 천명하고 국민의 기본권을 보장해 주는 근본규범입니다. 우리나라의 모든 국가기관의 권한 행사의 준거이며 대한민국의 질서는 헌법을 정점으로 하는 법치주의의 실현입니다. 따라서 정치학도로서 헌법의 구조와 기본원리를 이해하는 것은 필수적인 것입니다. 본 수업은 수강생들에게 우리 헌법의 기초 이론을 설명함으로서 학생들이 헌정주의와 법치주의가 가지는 의미를 실질적으로 이해할 수 있도록 할 예정입니다. 

2. 이 수업이 수강생들에게 ""법과 친해지는"" 계기가 되었으면 합니다. 규범학인 법학의 성격을 이해하도록 하고 이 후 진로에 있어서도 법과 관련된 부분을 고민할 수 있는 기회를 주고자 합니다. 

3. 헌법과 관련하여 통치구조론은 기존 정치외교학과의 다른 수업 커리큘럼을 통해 학습할 기회가 많았을 것입니다. 따라서 본 수업은 기본권론 중심으로 헌법의 기초이론을 살펴볼 예정입니다. 

4. 우리 헌법은 1987년 헌법에 의하여 도입된 헌법재판소의 활동에 의하여 비로소 구체적으로 살아있는 법으로 작동하였다고 해도 과언이 아닙니다. 수강생들은 본 수업을 통하여 우리 헌법재판소의 역할을 학습하고 중요 헌법재판소 결정례를 학습할 것입니다.   

5. 우리의 헌정질서는 역사적으로 치열한 투쟁을 통해 만들어진 것이며 수많은 사람들이 헌법실천적 개입을 통하여 이루어낸 “우리의 삶의 모습”입니다. 본 수업을 통하여 헌법이 저멀리 어딘가에 존재하는 것이 아니라 우리 생활 속에 존재한다는 사실을 느꼈으면 좋겠습니다. “법치”라는 가치가 통치자의 권력 유지, 특정집단의 이익 보호를 위한 방패가 아니라 국민들의 자유와 인권을 보호하는 수단이며 자유와 평등을 실현시키기 위한 방법이라는 것을 느꼈으면 좋겠습니다"

정당론 ,"정당 정치의 이론과 실제를 다룹니다. 이론은 전 세계적으로 나타나는 일반화된 현상을 위주로 하고, 실제는 한국정당정치에서 나타나는 현상을 위주로 할 것입니다. 정치현상을 제도권 정치와 비제도권 정치의 조합으로 하여, 제도권 정치의 대표적 기능을 수행하는 정당의 역할과 기능을 급변하는 현대 사회 속에서 어떻게 규정할 것인지를 한 학기 동안 고민할 것입니다. 강의의 방향은 party competition에 집중하여 정치 현상을 설명하고자 하는 것입니다. 정치는 정당이 주체이고, 그러한 경쟁이 일어나는 두 중요 분야가 선거와 의회라는 분야라는 것입니다. 수업의 최종적 목적은 민주 사회에서 정당의 바람직한 역할과 기능에 관하여 사상적, 경험적 근거를 마련하는 것으로 귀결됩니다."
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS ,"This course provides a sweeping overview of the American political tradition.  We will trace the origins of the United States Constitution and the development of the federal government, paying particular attention to the relationships among the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government and the distribution of power among political institutions across the national, state and local levels.  We also will study the nature of campaigns and elections, citizen participation and public opinion, as well the roles of political parties, interest groups and the news media.  All of this will be addressed with a sweeping historical perspective as well as in relation to the current public health and leadership crisis in the United States and the upcoming presidential election in November.   You will be encouraged to think for yourself about the political development of the United States in a global context and communicate your views in a logical and persuasive manner."

RECONCILIATION AND JUSTICE IN EAST ASIA ,"The course will explore the politics of memory  and reconciliation in East Asia, focusing on three core countries, China, Japan, and Korea, but not limited to them. While there are rising demands on building cooperation among the countries in East Asia, these core countries also have shown great difficulty to resolve the historical issues.  As the various narratives of the nation-building are intricately intertwined with ideology, war, and colonial experiences, the region has grown a sense of hostility that is difficult to resolve, wounds of war violence, Orientalist demeanor, and insoluble hatred for each other. Many international relations scholars tend to regard this difficulty of historical reconciliation only as an obstacle to create international cooperation in this region, but because historical issues in East Asia rooted in deeper identity issues, we need to diagnosis this problem more carefully.
 
In order to understand these phenomena, we need to look at issues such as nationalism, politics of memory, transitional justice, reconciliation, and post-colonialism, with a view that crosses the disciplines of academic fields over anthropology, sociology, political science, and international politics.

The course first focuses on the scholastic debates on memory and reconciliation in East Asia. International relations, international laws, transnational justice, political science, and memory studies look differently on the issue. The course will cover the key literatures on the issue to understand different layers and perspectives to deal with the issue. Second, the course will investigate the salient issues regarding memory problem and future reconciliation in different parts in East Asia."

POLITICAL DATA ANALYSIS: A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH ,"This course is designed to introduce students to the skills for interpreting, conducting, presenting, and analyzing political science statistical research. Over the course of the term, you will learn how to think like social scientists while developing various skills required by the discipline: How to choose which method to employ, how to undertake original research (complete with data collection and analysis), and how to present your findings to colleagues. The goal at the end of this class is to help you understand and conduct quantitative political research that will be useful in both academic and professional settings.

On successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
1. Describe and assess the logic of political science research in particular and of scientific research in general;
2. Comprehend the basic concepts, steps, and design involved in the systematic research process; 
3. Achieve an intuitive understanding on using statistical software for data analysis;
4. Learn how to analyze data, communicate research findings, and be an intelligent consumer of research."
국제개발협력과EU ,"본 과정은 국제기구를 통해 국제개발협력이 어떻게 이루어지고 있는지 이해하는데 그 목적이 있다. 이를 위해 국제기구의 역사와 기능, 개발협력에 관한 이론 그리고 실제 사례를 분석한다. 여기에서 다루어질 주요 주제들로는 통상과 발전, Aid, Governance, 지역주의, 개발전략, 인권, 환경 등이며, 대상 국제기구는 UN, WTO, EU,OECD, ASEAN 등이다."
POLITICS OF COLLABORATION AND INTEGRATION IN EUROPE ,"Europe has changed dramatically since the end of the Second World War, and the pace of transformation across the continent continues to intensify.  The nation-states of Western Europe have traded centuries of imperial rivalry and warfare for economic and political collaboration, most notably through the European Union.   With several former Communist countries as the newest members, this experiment in political integration ? the authentic ‘New Europe’ ? continues to cross new milestones and face formidable challenges, the most recent being the British vote to withdraw from the European Union. 

	 How did this stunning transformation take shape across Europe?   What kinds of political communities are emerging in Europe, both at the level of the European Union and within nation-states?   To what extent does the European Union pose a new model for global political and economic coordination?   Is it possible for robust democratic participation to thrive at the European level?  How are the individual countries negotiating their respective international roles and balancing domestic political considerations with collective goals for Europe?   How is the European Union negotiating political relationships with the rest of the world?    Can European countries navigate the transition into multicultural societies with large immigrant populations?   And ? the question on everyone’s mind these days ? can the European Union as we know it survive given the economic downturn that has opened up new fissures, tensions and vulnerabilities within this evolving political community?    This course will explore in depth these sorts of questions."
"POLITICS, MEDIA AND GLOBALIZATION ","This course will survey the past and present landscapes of media and politics, with particular emphasis on globalization and its transformative effects.  We will cover established dynamics at the heart of press-government relations as well as new trends on the cutting edge of digital media.  Topics will include the tricky relationships between government officials, journalists and citizens; the Internet and politics; “cyberactivism” in the social media age, the expansion of traditional media platforms into “emerging market” countries; alternative news and information outlets, and the many challenges posed by economic restructuring amid political and technological change as well as the high degree of ideological polarization that has resulted from the proliferation of new media sources.

By the end of the semester, you will have acquired a clear understanding of global media and politics, drawing upon key insights from the fields of political science and public communication as well as the interdisciplinary fields of global studies and and media studies.  You also will have strengthened your analytical and communication skills through the weekly reading and writing assignments that accompany this course as well as the required essays and term paper."
SEMINAR ON POLITICAL COMMUNICATION ,"This course provides a sweeping overview and analysis of political communication by examining the latest scholarship and public debate in this interdisciplinary field.  We will cover established dynamics at the core of press-government relations as well as new trends on the cutting edge of digital media.  Topics will include campaigns and elections; public opinion, public relations and political “spin;” political ideology and media bias; global press freedom; the Internet and politics; “digital citizenship” and “cyberactivism” and the impacts of new media, alternative media, and economic restructuring across the landscape of global media and politics.  In September and October, we will team up with students taking a similar course at DePaul University in Chicago, with each of you co-authoring a special collaborative paper with an assigned partner from DePaul focused on comparative news coverage related to issues of mutual concern to South Korea and the United States.

By the end of the semester, you will have acquired a clear understanding of political communication, drawing upon key insights from the fields of political science, public communication and media studies.  You also will have strengthened your analytical and communication skills through the weekly reading and writing assignments that accompany this course as well as the required essays and online collaborative project."
PUBLIC OPINION AND POLITICAL BEHAVIOR ,"This course is designed to explore the nature of public opinion and voting behavior of people. Additionally, it covers the election campaigning and upcoming presidential election in the United States for case study. Students will learn how to read and interpret the numbers of polls that are overwhelmingly too many in modern democracy. At the same time, they will learn how to use and manipulate public opinions (and polls) in real politics. 

The course consists of three broad subjects: the appropriate reading of poll numbers and public opinion, voting (and political) behavior of electorates, and political campaign. Building upon a background in classic political psychology studies and general understanding of voting behavior of people, we will closely follow the 2020 US presidential election."
사물정치론 ,"이 수업은 하나 또는 복수의 ‘사물(things, ?西/的)’을 다양한접근법을 사용하여 분석하고 이를 통해 그 사물이 존재하는 시공간의 환경, 주체, 그리고 그들의 상호작용에 대한 근본적인 원리와 성격 규명을 목적으로 리서치 연습을 진행하는 세미나이다. 이 수업은 기존의 정치학적 시각, 논리, 이론과 방법론을 기본적으로 활용하되 이에 얽매이지 않고 다양한 학제 간 및 융복합적 접근법을 중심으로 비전통적인 그리고 기존에 존재하지 않았던 형태의 창조적인 시각과 접근법을 고안하여 사물 그 자체와 사물을 둘러싼 많은 환경, 행위자, 다른 사물들 간의 인과/상관관계들을 분석, 그 사물의 정치적 측면을 이해한다. 예를 들어 플라스틱의 정치, 화장품의 정치, 미세먼지의 정치, 스마트폰의 정치, 철도의 정치, 숲의 정치, 씨앗의 정치, 참치의 정치, 재난의 정치, 온라인게임의 정치 등은 기존의 정치학에서 면밀하게 다루어진 리서치의 대상이 아니지만 우리 개개인의 일상뿐만 아니라 개인부터 글로벌까지 전 분석 수준에서 인류의 삶에 핵심적인 변수로서 존재하며 움직이고 있다. 또한 이들은 정치학과 동시에 생태학, 인류학, 경제학, 경영학, 문학, 철학, 심리학, 물리학, 화학, 지구과학, 컴퓨터공학, 건축학, 도시공학, 디자인학, 농학, 의학 등 수많은 다른 학문적 접근들을 활용해야만 입체적이고 창조적이며 생산적인 이해가 가능하다. 이러한 비관습적인 리서치 또는 지적 연습을 통하여 학생들은 이러한 사물들의 정치에 대한 학문적, 정책적, 부가가치창출적인 대안을 ? ‘문제해결’과 ‘새로운 문제설정’의 맥락에서? 제시하여 사회 혁신에 공헌하는 공공성의 의미와 개개인의 사적 이익 추구의 조화를 체험한다."
ECONOMIC STATECRAFT: ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND AID ,"Over the past decades, states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations have relied on economic tools of diplomacy for many purposes. This course focuses on two economic instruments: economic sanctions and foreign aid. Economic sanctions have been one of the most popular instruments of coercion. However, conventional wisdom is that sanctions have not been successful as policymakers had expected them to be. Why? How can we define sanctions and their success? Under what conditions are sanctions more likely to succeed? Are there any unintended consequences of sanctions? Foreign aid represents the ``carrots`` side of economic statecraft. While foreign aid is widely used by many actors, there is a consensus that recipient countries have failed to accomplish economic and political development as much as one would expect. What determines donor decisions on aid disbursements? What are the effects of foreign aid on recipient countries from economic and political perspectives? To answer these questions, we examine the effects of a variety of domestic, international, and cultural factors on the initiation and outcomes of economic sanctions and aid. Throughout the course, we focus on both general studies (e.g., theoretical and empirical literature on economic statecraft) and a few cases of sanctions and aid (e.g., UN sanctions against DPRK or ODA conducted by KOICA) to get balanced perspectives. This course will be taught with Jaesuk Park."
정의론 ,"In this semester, because of COVID-19, the course will proceed with on-line classes by using zoom (Professor Jang`s zoom ID: 617 242 6570).

	This course is concerned with analyzing major theories of justice in political philosophy. It covers utilitarianism, liberal equality, libertarianism, communitarianism, etc. With reading major texts written by or related to great political philosophers ranging from ancient times to contemporary world, such as Plato, Aristotle, Kant, John Rawls, Robert Nozick, Michael Sandel, Will Kymlicka, and so on, students are going to discuss main ideas and arguments in major theories of justice and their implications to practical politics and more particularly to contemporary liberal democracies including Korean democracy. 

	Specifically in this semester, we take Michael Sandel, Justice: What`s the Right Thing to Do and Will Kimlicka, Contemporary Political Philosophy: An Introduction as main texts. And for the sake of convenient class proceeding, each week students are supposed to read proper chapters of the book along with other supporting materials relevant to the week`s topic."

RULE OF LAW IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT ,"One interesting phenomenon at the turn of the twenty-first century has been the global popularity of “rule of law” as an ideal to aspire for. For many 
countries coming out from under communist or authoritarian rule with state-centered economic regimes, the rule of law was seen as the key to their successful transition to a more democratic and market friendly systems. For their part, the more advanced countries of the world and international organization, as well as many private institutions, sponsored and organized numerous rule-of-law assistance programs to promote the ideal worldwide. 
Almost twenty years later, there are differences of opinion as to whether rule of law has actually spread to more countries of the world. What is undisputed, however, is that the term has gained a status as an unquestioned legitimizing principle. Like “democracy,” it is now a badge of honor which every country wants to claim for itself in order to be considered a member of the community of civilized nations. Even very oppressive dictatorial regimes claim, at least in their official rhetoric, that they are committed to the rule of law. 
This course will be an investigation into various aspects of this phenomenon called the rule of law. Recognizing that the idea has been around for 
centuries, we will start with an inquiry into the various ways in which people have understood the term. What does it mean to be under the rule of law? Where did the idea originate from? We will then turn to the more recent career of the ideal. Why has rule of law become such a popular goal worldwide? Who promotes the rule of law, and for what reasons? Are there any downsides to the ideal of rule of law? Can it--indeed, should it--be implemented in any country? What are, if any, the sources of threat to the ideal of rule of law?"
UNITED NATIONS AND GLOBAL JUSTICE ,"The aim of this course is to understand the basic framework and the key functions of the United Nations.

Video lectures will be made and uploaded every week! (NO real-time online lectures!)"
INTRODUCTION TO U.S. LAW ,"The goal of this course is to help the students to understand the law and the operation of legal system in the United States. After learning about the basic framework of law and legal system of the United States, we will focus on more contemporary issues such as Black Lives Matter movement by comparing present-day debates to those of older days in similar circumstances. Would history repeat itself? There would not be any better time to discuss about this question than now."
UT세미나(JUSTICE AND WRITING) ,"The organizational approach of the course is to examine criminal justice cutting across its varied legal and non-legal contexts, such as criminal law, social linguistics, sociology, court psychology, etc. Specific topics include the study of the organizations and people (police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, and corrections officials) that make up the criminal justice system and further discussion on controversial issues will be conducted including junk science in the criminal court, translation and interpretation in criminal proceedings, and minority’s fundamental rights and utilization of expert testimonies, etc. Because this is a dynamic field with new developments occurring on a regular basis, we will incorporate into our discussion references to various developments and new legal issues that may arise during the course. We will have writing workshp every two weeks."
COMPARATIVE KOREAN COMMERCIAL LAW ,"Among wide variety of topics regarding commercial law, this course will focus on the law of corporations. After a brief introduction on the basic principles and theories of comparative commercial law in general, we will explore various legal issues surrounding the legal structure and characteristics of business corporations by tracking the life cycle of such theoretically immortal artificial person.

Goals: After successful completion of the course, students will be able to understand the foundations of commercial law and law of corporations."

              “Diplomacy is the art of telling people to go to hell in such a way that they ask for directions.” -Winston S. Churchill

This class explores intersections among diplomacy, multilateralism, and global governance, emphasizing diplomacy’s underlying theories, modes, objectives, and practical applications. We consider traditional diplomacy, newer forms involving civil society and digital media, the influence of domestic politics, and diplomacy’s future. We apply these frameworks to great, middle, and small-power diplomacy, and diplomacy in East Asia. Our modules are:: 
(1) DIPLOMACY’S THEORIES & STYLES
(2) DOMESTIC POLITICS & DIPLOMACY  
(3) THE NEGOTIATION GAME
(4) MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY 
(5) CRISIS DIPLOMACY
(6) PUBLIC DIPLOMACY’S SOFT POWER
(7) ECONOMIC DIPLOMACY

(9) NON-DIPLOMAT DIPLOMATS
(10) MIDDLE & SMALL POWER DIPLOMACY
(11) DIPLOMACY IN EAST ASIA’S CAULDRON
(12) DIPLOMACY’S FUTURE

We approach each topic, theoretically and empirically, with original and explanatory text, lectures, discussions, and activities:
(1) Lecture and the student leader introduce the topic and text.   (2) Small group class discussion, followed by class-wide discussion.
(3) Periodic activities, including diplomacy simulations and real-world case studies, deepen students’ understanding of theory and its applications. 
As a capstone project during the final weeks, students will conduct a sophisticated real-world diplomatic conference. Students may introduce ‘real-world’ events, so that we may consider diplomatic and governance implications.

CRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE ,"This course will introduce students to the historical, theoretical, and legal foundations of criminal law and procedure. Along the way we will consider what rights and duties citizens have with respect to each other; which kinds of behavior the law enforces vs. which kinds it leaves up to private citizens to figure out for themselves; and the kinds of restrictions a just legal system must enforce against itself in order to ensure the rights of citizens. In addition to the knowledge component of the course, students will get significant experience analyzing issues and developing reasoned arguments to support their conclusions."
KOREAN CIVIL LAW AND SOCIETY ,"This course provides opportunities for students to engage in dialogue with the professor, you’re your colleagues and with experts in the field to explore selected issues, case studies and policy debates in the Korean Civil Law, Civil Law History, and current issues in Korean Civil Law in a highly interactive seminar.  The focus of this course will be to understand, analyze and evaluate the dynamics of the Korean Civil Law, and the structure and operation of the Korean Civil order, in historical context and from the vantage point of divergent intellectual traditions and analytical frameworks.   As participants will teach and learn from each other, everyone is expected to have carefully read assigned materials in advance of each session and to be well prepared to discuss the materials with the professor.  Attendance, active participation and critical thinking are essential to the success of the seminar. Due to COVID-19 breakout the course will be mostly online."
PHILOSOPHY OF PUNISHMENT ,"Punishment--defined broadly as the taking of some corrective action in response to an offense--is a staple of every society. It plays an important role in politics, business transactions, criminal justice, the education system, families, our personal relationships, and even in social media interactions. This course will examine the four major components of punishment--incapacitation, rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution--analyzing them for moral justification and practical effectiveness in the variety of realms where punishment is employed. Although the justification for punishment is to enforce norms and hold society together, we will explore the many ways in which punishment as typically practiced actually drives us apart, and explore more effective ways to deal with transgression in both formal and informal settings, drawing on philosophy, psychology, law, game theory, and case studies along the way.

Target knowledge and skills to be developed:

- Understanding of the core justifications and methods of punishment
- Understanding the basis for making ethical and policy decisions
- Ethical and policy analysis
- Critical thinking and debate skills
- Clear and effective persuasive writing"
INTRODUCTION TO QUANTITATIVE RISK MANAGEMENT ,AI
경제수학(1) ,"Modern mainstream economics and/or econometrics take mathematical approaches
to address economic problems formally and analyze them precisely. As the 
emphasis on mathematical approaches have been put very heavily in the field of 
economics, it is now very difficult for students without knowledge on 
mathematics to study further advanced economics and/or econometrics courses.
Therefore, the main goal of Mathematics for Economics is in providing students 
studying in the field of economics with the basic ideas on mathematical 
approaches which have been frequently used for economics and/or econometrics. 
Specifically, students are expected to be able to do the following by taking 
Mathematics for Economics :
  - Understand economic and/or econometric problems associated with 
mathematics without much difficulty, when taking other economics and/or 
econometrics courses;
  - Begin to think of economic and/or econometric problems by rigorous 
mathematical formalization and analysis."

Data Science is the field of study that deals with data acquisition, data analysis, and decision making with domain knowledge. In the field of Data Science, data refer to either structured or unstructured data, which is frequently called Big Data. Tools for analyzing Big Data in Data Science are called machine learning that is a narrow field of Statistics, and machine learning is known as a workhorse of AI. 

This mathematical statistics course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the mathematical study of statistics (or machine learning). Without the knowledge of mathematical statistics, you cannot fully understand machine learning algorithms including Deep Learning. 

Topics include probability, random vaiables, univariate or multivariate distributions, elementary statistical inference, and limiting distributions. Emphasis will be on the theoretical development and practical implementation of each topic, including definitions, theorems, proofs, computer programming, and simulations."
국제금융시장분석 ,"Students are expected to apply economic theories to real-world issues. This means that students should read a lot of materials (mostly from FT or WSJ, but not restricted to these sources) relevant to the course throughout the semester. Whether you read it or not will be tested in the exams. For problem sets, students are also required to use a simple computer program (such as Excel) to download data and analyze them, which implies a learning-by-doing process in the class. This course is elective, which means students do not have to take the course to fulfill their requirements. For those who do not intend to put any effort, but simply take whatever easy courses to graduate, I strongly advise not to take this course for mutual benefit. If you think reading FT or WSJ articles, having group presentations, or exploring economic/financial data over the internet is a waste of time, please, and please avoid taking this course. I strongly recommend students to take a look at the exam samples before enrolling in the class. Once you enroll in the class, you will be given exams with a similar format and difficulty. Final exams are cumulative and the average scores from both classes have been 60ish. Thus it would help align our mutual expectations and eliminate any asymmetric information.

         “The just man is not the product of a day, but of a long brooding and a painful birth...."" Charles Wagner

We discuss seminal social justice philosophies in the context of five contemporary social justice issues: 

(1) REPARATIONS FOR HISTORICAL INJUSTICE (LIBERTARIAN PERSPECTIVE)

(2) REMOVING HISTORY TO PROMOTE SOCIAL JUSTICE (COMMUNITARIAN PERSPECTIVE)

(3) BIPOC & SEXUAL PREFERENCE/IDENTITY MOVEMENTS (POST-MODERN PERSPECTIVE)

(4) COVID-19’S IMPACT ON ECONOMIC & SOCIAL EQUALITY (LIBERAL PERSPECTIVE)

(5) 4th INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION’S IMPACT ON ECONOMIC & SOCIAL EQUALITY (RADICAL EQUALITY PERSPECTIVE) 

We approach each topic, philosophically and empirically, with original and explanatory text, lectures, discussions, and activities:

(1) Lecture and the student leader introduce the topic and text.
(2) Small group class discussion, followed by class-wide discussion.
(3) Periodic activities deepen theoretical understanding and ‘real world’ applications. 

In the final weeks, students will present on their group’s research project.

GENERAL BIOLOGY FOR MODERN LIFE SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY ,"Biology in layman`s perspective

Biology is directly connected with health issues and becomes one of the critical parts of the world we live in.
Even though you are not interested in biology, you have often encountered the terms such as GMO, cancer, alzheimer, genome, CRISPR,  stem cell therapy.
This course ""GENERAL BIOLOGY FOR MODERN LIFE SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY"" aims  to develop the basic concepts of modern biology related
to our health and industry for freshmen and sophomores of humanities or social science majors who want to study biology as a libearl art course.
In this course we will explore essential biology and physiology, and also discuss some cultural texts that contain terms of modern biology."
IT AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHANGE ,"In the world of information technology, it seems like change is the only constant. In less than a human lifetime, this technological torrent has transformed virtually every facet of our society ? and the transformation is just beginning. Even though the computer and the Internet are among the most important inventions of our era, but few people know what the computer is and what it can (and cannot) do. This course is to illustrate the basics of information technology and how computers and networks are used as practical tools.
A deeper understanding of information technology will help you answer many more meaningful questions. For example, Will automation result in massive, long-term unemployment? Will information technology be a tool to bring the people of the world closer together, or will it divide a permanent wedge between the rich and the poor?

This course provides clear explanations of the basic concepts of computer hardware and software ? concepts that are often misunderstood by students ? even those who have considerable computer experience. Additionally, this course covers much greater depth on network technology in general and the Internet in particular.
The second goal goes beyond simply describing the latest gadgets and explains many of the benefits we derive (and risks we tolerate) when we incorporate information and technology into our lives."

"KNOWLEDGE, INFORMATION AND SOCIETY ","Knowledge is not produced solely by the pursuit of discovering absolute truth. Production and consumption of knowledge is socially embedded, and therefore can not be politically, culturally and socially neutral.
This course explores 1) how legitimacy and validity is attached to and detached from knowledge under the specific social contexts, 2) how accessibility to knowledge is allowed and denied to different social groups, 3) how knowledge is accepted and rejected by the public, and 4) how we can ensure democratically accountable production and consumption of knowledge.
In addition to classic literature in the sociology of knowledge, this course also deals with new challenges and promises brought by, in particular, the information-communication technologies.

Goals:
1) Students will be familiarized to main theories and concepts in the field of knowledge and information studies. 
2) Students will be able to properly apply those theories and concepts to real-world cases. 
3) Students will be able to construct their own research questions and develop logically-supported arguments. 
4) Students will acquire academic writing skills."
POLICY EVALUATION IN PRACTICE ,"Students will learn general theories and techniques on policy-making process and evaluation. Also the class introduces real-life examples on public policy and students will learn an analytical framework to understand the daily operation of government and public sector.


""Policy analysis as art and craft as well as science"""
TECHNOLOGY AND WORK ,"From factory machines, railroads, telegraph, electricity, petrochemical substances at the Second Industrial Revolution to the contemporary bio-digital revolution, technological changes have exerted great impacts on how human labor is organized, mobilized, utilized, and exploited. Technologies have affected the relationship between humans and tools, created new breeds of workers (e.g. “proletariat class,” “white-collars,” “knowledge-workers,” “clinical laborers or bio-surrogates” and also many kinds of invisible workers such as undocumented immigrants), and changed workplace environment.
  Though technological changes are often recognized as (and indeed they are) “progress,” they also interact/exacerbate the existing social inequalities and injustices and undermine the hard-won labor rights. 
  This course explores the relationship between technology and human labor, with a special interest in its socio-political implications. We will mostly focus on market labors, but also include relevant discussions on non-market labor.

Goals:
1) Students will be familiarized to main theories and concepts in the field of technology and work studies. 
2) Students will be able to properly apply those theories and concepts to real-world cases. 
4) Students will acquire academic writing skills."
SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE ,"This course provides students with an opportunity to learn emerging areas of study including social neuroscience, affective neuroscience, and neuroeconomics. More specifically, it covers social and emotional aspects of the human mind and behavior (e.g., social intelligence, helping behavior, social influence, anger and aggression). Throughout the semester, students will learn theoretical and practical issues in the human and animal research that used neuroscientific methods. I hope that students become more attentive to and observant of their social behavior and be able to translate their observations into psychological terms and concepts by the end of the semester, and ultimately convert them to social policies. 

Students will be learning by the means of lecture slides, demo activities, discussions, and reading. Slide presentations will be the main way to deliver knowledge in class. However, student’s active participation is an important part in this course. They will also be asked to participate in demo activities designed to experience or test psychological concepts or effects, or to engage in discussion on a certain topic. The topic to discuss will be announced beforehand and provided with homework readings prior to the discussion. Students will be asked to read the articles relevant to class material, and to write their reactions to the articles."
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ,"In this course we look at the practical use and effects of artificial intelligence to increase efficient practices in resolving disputes, but also consider various legal and ethical concerns that may arise."
INTRODUCTION TO GLOBAL AFFAIRS ,"This course surveys the broad topics related to globalization and its political implications. We will start with the course with a basic framework of conceptualizing globalization as well as understanding the roles of international institutions. Then we will move on to see how we can use this framework as a tool to approach a broad array of contemporary global problems, such as gender inequality, global health, and migration. This course is not an introduction to international studies that focuses on the rigorous learning of the theories of international relations. Rather, this course is to provide a broad overview to the politics of various global affairs and to advance our understanding on how different party interests converge and diverge on these matters."
THEORIES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY ,See the attachment.
BRICS AND NEW EMERGING POWERS ,"Course Description:
The acronym “BRIC” stands for the “Big Four” countries of Brazil, Russia, 
India, and China, which are the newly emerging economic powers in the age of 
globalization. In 2009, the BRIC countries officially created an international 
organization that was named “BRIC.” In 2010, South Africa became a member 
nation of this organization, and the group was renamed “BRICS.” For better 
understanding of the “BRICS” countries as leading emerging markets and 
powers, this course is designed to investigate the history, politics, and 
culture of each member nation.
Course Objectives:
This course will enable students to:
1) Understand BRICS as the leading economic powers in the age of 
globalization.  
2) Critically examine current political, economic, and cultural events and 
issues of BRICS in newspapers, films, and other media.

through the prism of such issues as internal unrest, dispute resolution, 
climate change, globalization, development, terrorism, use of force, pirates, 
cyberlaw, torture, human rights, genocide, the United Nations, the World Bank 
and non-governmental organizations. Students are encouraged to follow global 
events during the course to enhance their understanding. What are the 
limitations of international law? How can it improve our world? How does it 
work and how should it work? Issues will be explored through interactive 
analysis of actual cases of international law."
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND URBANIZATION ,"The urban region (City) has provided space and opportunity for getting information and jobs. 50% of the current world population is located in the Urban region, and it would be 66% in 2050. Particularly urbanization in the future will mostly happen in developing countries in Asia and South America. Considering the rapid trend of urbanization, urban regions should be considered as the main focus of sustainable development of the world. This course will provide a basic understanding of urban development issues, and try to establish a balanced view for solutions and alternatives for sustainable development of the urban regions."
"COOPERATION AND SUPPORT FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: ACTORS, ACTIONS, AND AID FINANCING ","The course aims to understand diverse actors that contribute to sustainable development, including pro-poor economic growth, poverty alleviation, and livelihoods improvement. Students will learn about the logic and rationale of those actors, such as the United Nations Programs, Funds, and Specialized Agencies, multilateral institutions and bilateral agencies.

We will discuss the strength and weaknesses of all techniques. Recent examples from the literature and seminar talks presented by visitors will be discussed.

The class is very much intended to give students the tools they need to determine structures of molecule and biomolecules. Our objective will be to determine what kind of data you need for your situation, how best to get them, and how to interpret them. All students will be trained in interpreting individual spectra and sets of spectra obtained by different methods, so that molecular compounds and materials are quickly and efficiently characterized with respect to their structure, potential dynamics, and stereochemistry (conformation and configuration). Rather than reading or memorizing, most of your time in this course will be spent solving spectral problems. 

Many of the principles in understanding interpretation of spectra come down to fundamentals that you learned in general and organic chemistry. Concepts of isotopes, electronegativity, bond polarity, resonance structures, molecular orbitals, hybridization, bond angles, functional groups, hydrogen bond, stereochemistry, conformation, aromaticity, pKa and others, are all important aspects that come into play in this course in one way or another. A firm understanding of these principles will be strongly beneficial."
PHYSIOLOGY ,We will study the basic physiology of different organs in human.
EPIGENETICS AND HUMAN DISEASE ,"It is clear that DNA sequence alone is not enough to explain the large range of variations in gene expression.

FRESHMAN WRITING INTENSIVE SEMINAR ,"This course is based on three principles: 1) writing as a method of communication; 2) writing as a tool for critical thinking; 3) writing as a process. 

Writing with accuracy and clarity is an essential ability in both academic and non-academic situations, more so because of the growing importance of written communication in an international environment. Further, writing is an important tool to develop one`s intellectual ability to participate in academic discourse based on critical analysis and logical composition. Good writing is evidence of a clear understanding of complex ideas, which is an ability needed to grow in most career fields as well as all academic disciplines. To keep students further engaged, this course will have an ongoing theme throughout the semester: rewriting a story. By comparing the works as they are adapted into different contexts and genres, students will have an opportunity to engage themselves in close analysis and reasoned argument based on the similarities and differences they find from the works.

At the end of the semester, students are expected to harvest the following abilities: 
1) Read a variety of works and interpret them based on their own perspective and reasoned analysis. 
2) Communicate their message in a manner that is appropriate for the genre, purpose, and audience. In particular, deliver an academic idea logically and convincingly in both written and verbal communication. 
3) Develop confidence in experimenting with a less familiar genre for both reading and writing. 
4) Perceive writing as a process."
WORLD LITERATURE: EAST ASIAN LITERATURE ,"Nation and Gender in Korean Cinema

What does the nation mean for modern Korean women and men? How are notions of gender--femininity, masculinity, and in-between--constructed, mobilized, and managed by the nation? How do power dynamics among gender, sexuality, class, and ethnicity change and/or evolve across different historical and socio-cultural circumstances of the nation? Most of all, what is the role played by Korean cinema as a vessel of (imagining) historical and cultural representation--in both domestic and global contexts?

This course explores how the complex relation between gender and nationhood are represented--molded and subverted--in Korean cinema. We will first develop a nuanced understanding of the historical transformations that took place in Korea--from colonization to the Korean War to military dictatorship to participatory democracy to neoliberal globalization--with the understanding that films are cultural products that cannot exist in a vacuum. We will then shift our focus to investigating a wide array of films under the umbrella issues of nation, gender, modernity, and postmodernity. 

This course aims for students to: (a) become familiar with the history and film of Korea; (b) gain critical perspectives on the representations and constructions of gender and nation in Korea; (c) practice and hone critical analytic skills; and (d) present complex ideas in a persuasive and organized manner."
WORLD LITERATURE: MODERN EUROPEAN LITERATURE ,"""Albert Camus""
In this course, students will be introduced to novelistic works by Albert Camus, one of the leading figures of the mid 20th-century French intellectual scene. Often categorized as part of the “existentialist school,” Camus displays a distinctive affinity with Fyodor Dostoevsky, much more than with his contemporaries, even as his works persistently engage with his Algerian origin. We will sample some of Dostoevsky’s works to supplement our understanding of Camus’s aesthetics and philosophy."
WORLD LITERATURE: ENGLISH & AMERICAN LITERATURE ,"Korean American writers and their literature have addressed their own migration experience. This course will look at how Korean American writers understand their ‘in-between’ identities in terms of ethnicity and cultural backgrounds. Focusing on reading contemporary Korean American novels, students will be able to learn how to analyze fictional pieces from the cultural studies perspective."
WORLD LITERATURE: COMPARATIVE LITERATURE ,"The refugee crises have been a global issue that calls for transnational solidarity. Protecting their human rights conflicts with border controls. Thus, the refugee presence challenges the modern nation-state system while asking nation-states how they recognize human rights of stateless people. This course will also attempt to understand who refugees are and explore how we can solve this politically complicated issue through inclusion, not exclusion. We will first read articles about migration and refugee studies to get a general sense of refugee crises on the global level. Next, we will learn about Critical Refugee Studies, focusing on how they develop Critical Refugee Studies as an important part of migration studies and articulate the refugee experience. Lastly, based on the readings we read, we will analyze the ways that refugees are represented in films and literature. In doing so, students will be able to consider a more ethical way of representing refugee characters, allowing them to own their agencies."
WORLD LITERATURE: MODERN JAPANESE LITERATURE ,"""Haruki Murakami Writes Sexual Relationship""

Haruki Murakami is one of the most celebrated contemporary authors in the world. While deploying fantasy as the main mode and material of narrative, which makes his work highly readable and popular, Murakami does not exclude from his authorial concern serious matters in individual life, politics, and culture which literature is traditionally seen as duty-bound to represent and reflect on. Thus situated between popular consumption and serious engagement, Murakami’s fiction makes an effective point of entry into world literature today. Of particular interest for this course is Murakami’s persistent reference to and thematization of the relationship between man and woman mediated by, and occurring in the site of, sexual difference. In this course, students will be introduced to a selection of Murakami’s work from his earlier works to the most recent titles in his long career. Our aim will be twofold: to familiarize ourselves with the Murakami-esque aesthetics?global cultural knowledge by now?and to analyze the text, that is, to recognize its structure, logic, and desire beyond the story, i.e., characters, plot, or immediate affective or moral reactions."
WORLD HISTORY: GROUP I ,"This course entails a history of Korea according to the peninsula’s cultural interactions with the rest of the world---particularly East Asia and the West. (To that end, treatments of Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Indian, and Yellow River civilizations---civilizations typically associated with conventional world history classes---will NOT turn up in this course.) Rather than study Korea’s cultural phenomena as belief systems divorced from each other, we will analyze these cultural expressions as products of forces like convergence, conflict, and/or dialogue with other ideas."
SOCIAL COGNITION ,"Instructor: Philip S. Cho

Course Description:
The social sciences are at the cusp of a revolution with recent advances in neuroimaging and data science. Hyperscanning techniques simultaneously recording neural activity from multiple people are revealing patterns of brain-to-brain synchrony during social interaction. Analysis of Big Data can now provide an empirical foundation for predictive models of behavior. Together, the emerging field of social neuroscience is able to address questions long speculated over in the humanities. 

This course explores the foundations of this coming revolution in the field of social cognition from multidisciplinary perspectives combining the sciences, humanities, and engineering.  Special attention will be given to the neurological basis of group behavior such as collective emotion, attention, and action. This will also involve studying theories of social interaction such as love and attachment, mass religious and political rituals, and the historical evolution of social cognition.

The advantage of small class size is the ability to adapt readings and topics to the interest of the students. In addition to lecture, the class will also have the flexibility of a guided reading and discussion tutorial. Exploratory labs will also provide hands-on experience. 

Note, for Fall 2020 this class will be online. This may change to in-person class only if the covid-19 situation improves and the university allows it."
WORLD HISTORY: GROUP II ,"This course surveys Korean history from ancient to present while looking at how it is related to world history. The course focuses on how Korean history was influenced by the global changes as well as how it contributed and influenced East Asian history and by extension, world history. While focusing on Korea, the class takes a broader and comparative perspective to look at the historical changes in East Asia together; it compares Korean historical experiences with those of Japan and China and pays attention to the intertwined historical experiences, and examines the historical controversies among the East Asian states, conflicting historical interpretations, and discusses the possible reconciliation and the transnational efforts to solve these issues. Then the class discusses how Korean historical experiences can contribute to the understanding of global history. The students will learn that the perspective they gained while studying Korean history will help them understand world history better. 
While taking a macro view that looks at the global changes, it will also focus on the lived experience of people; how the Korea people exerted their agency while interacting with the global changes. To assist the understanding of history as the lived experience of people, the course will blend in short novels and literature as well as the popular films based on Korean history. This course is conducted online/non-face-to-face. Students will watch the online lecture videos assigned for the week and will participate in online discussion activities.

By the end of the course, students should be able to:
-	Have a clear understanding of the changes in Korean history as well as historical controversies concerning Korea and other parts of the world.
-	Critically assess various historical interpretations and come up with their own logical, informed opinions through discussion. 
-	Use primary sources as a tool to see changes in historical understanding."

In addition, students will become familiar with the language and cultural background of everyday life situations likely to be encountered in contemporary Japanese society."
WORLD PHILOSOPHY ,"This course examines what “the good life” consists of.  We will begin with an examination of consumerism and how consumption and status dominates many of the decisions we make with what to do with our limited time on this planet.  In the first half of the class we deal explicitly with money.  Given that we have to make a living, we will ask how we should do so.  In addition to exploring some basic concepts of financial literacy, we will explore how career choices and the desire for high-salaried jobs interact with consumerist aspirations.  The first half ends with the students writing a paper envisioning a future career path and explaining why they have chosen this path (money, passion, duty, etc.)
In the second half of the course we will assume that, one way or another, our pecuniary needs are satisfied.  What then?  What should one devote their life to?  What makes a life good?  We will explore several philosophical answers to this question including classic works of Hedonism, Stoicism, and Existentialism.   The course culminates in one final paper where the student argues for and expands on a particular philosophy of life, and integrates this philosophy into their career path (possibly revising the first paper in light of further considerations."
CRITICAL REASONING ,"This course is dedicated to helping students be better thinkers.  The course begins by examining the probability you are right about everything.  Given that this is (spoiler) probably pretty low, students choose a single belief that is personally important, poorly supported by what they know, and which they are genuinely open to changing their minds about.  Over the course of the class we will start building up the tools for each student to examine that idea.  We begin by examining propositional logic as an ideal form of reasoning.  Here we will learn how to take a natural language argument, symbolize it, and analyze whether it is a good or bad argument.  Following this, we turn to the barriers that prevent us from learning we are wrong.  We look at psychological and social barriers that prevent people from changing their minds as well as common types of flawed arguments (i.e. fallacies).  In conclusion, we will consider what good reasoning looks like including reasoning from particular cases to general principles and inference to the best explanation."

TOPICS IN EUROPEAN HISTORY ,"Teaching Method: 100% online 

This course examines the pre-modern patterns of European arts patronage, collecting, and display that influenced the organization and form of the modern museum. Based on the innovations of late medieval patrons, states organized national museums or sponsored the institutionalization of prominent private collections.  Readings and coursework will adopt an interdisciplinary approach that draws on cultural and political history, art history, and cultural criticism and theory. Our goal is to begin to think about the acquisition and display of art and other museum artifacts in the broadest historical, aesthetic, philanthropic and institutional contexts. What do national museums reveal about the nations that sponsor them? What do municipal institutions tell us about a city, its historical profile, and the interests of its leading citizens and philanthropists? How have these institutions served (or possibly failed to serve) different urban, regional, and national constituencies? By tracing how Renaissance patterns of collecting and arts patronage ultimately influenced the organization of the first European museums, we will also see how this cultural tradition influenced the world’s first national museums. Ultimately, the history of collecting and the growth of museums constitute an important vector for understanding the integration of western and global cultures."
TOPICS IN CRITICAL THEORY ,"Course Description
We often hear that our attention spans are being foreshortened by television, advertising, and social media. According to this common lament, we are losing the capacity to reflect, contemplate and, in the title of last year’s bestseller by Jenny Odell, “do nothing.” (It made Obama’s list of favorite books from 2019... but not mine! Take this class instead.) Would it surprise you to learn that similar cultural observations were being made at least as long ago as the mid-19th century? As Walter Benjamin notes, the French lyric poet Charles Baudelaire explicitly addressed himself to a readership he suspected would not have the patience for lyric poetry. In his 1939 essay “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire,” Benjamin writes of this 19th-century public: “Willpower and the ability to concentrate are not their strong points.” Sound familiar?
This class explores the lived effects of the so-called “attention economy.” We will examine materialist accounts of contemporary experiences of time and historicize them with reference to analyses from the 1920s and 30s that linked the “culture of distraction” and “crisis of experience” in modern urban life to the rise of fascism. In the second half of the semester, we will focus on attempts to codify the effects of contemporary attentional demands into an aesthetics, as well as attempts to produce an aesthetics that reclaims or rehabilitates attention.
	Please note that this is a reading intensive class. Reading assignments will include lengthy texts written for a general audience, which you are asked to skim read, as well as short philosophical texts that will require close and careful reading. The reading assignments are designed to take a focused 8-10 hours per week.

TL;DR: If you find yourself feeling chronically impatient and want to understand why you feel that way, this class is for you. Be warned, though, there’s a lot of reading."
TOPICS IN CULTURAL STUDIES ,"Memory and Mass Media

How does one gain access to past events through which one did not live but one takes on as one`s own and informs one`s identity? This course explores memory in relation to global mass culture, looking in particular at the intersections of memory with media forms such as film, photography, art, architecture, and design. We will look at the foundational concepts of cultural memory and at technologies of memory, critical visuality, artistic engagements with memory, and memory’s remediation in mass media. 

Looking at a variety of texts, we will ask: How are historical pasts narrativized, represented, and circulated through mass media and culture? To what extent do modern technologies of mass culture--with their ability to transport individuals through time and space--function as technologies of memory? How do these technologies challenge the distinction between individual and collective memory? How do they introduce experience--and affect--as an important mode of knowledge acquisition? How might individuals be affected by memories of events through which they did not live? What, ultimately, is the shape and purpose of memory in an age of global mass media? Such questions will drive our investigation into the interrelationship of media forms with memory so as to rethink the place and task of memory in a (global) precarious world. 

This course aims for students to: (a) become familiar with key ideas and concepts in memory studies and visual culture; (b) gain insight into understanding contentious pasts; (c) develop abilities to critically examine primary and secondary sources; (d) hone skills to present clear and coherent arguments?verbal and written; (e) enjoy intellectual camaraderie!"

"TIME, MOTION AND COMMUNICATION ","The goal of this class is to prepare students to become designers in the areas 
of motion graphics and communication design. It provides a mixture of balanced 
collaborative work and individual exploration. Some projects of exploration 
include new narrative structures in new media, visual voice, and identity in 
digital formats; this visualizes complex information spaces, and strategic 
planning for communication systems. We are going to closely examine various 
motion graphic works such as movie opening title, game design, animation, 
promotion design, and etc. In order to create projects that are mentioned 
above, it needs planning, making, editing, and showing. At the end of the 
semester, this class will present a complete project and poster. Therefore, 
all students are required to cooperate with each other and participate in this 
class."
THEORIES AND PRACTICES OF PUBLIC ART ,"Contemporary arts are installed and practised outside indoor spaces normally called galleries and museums and enter into environments and everyday life of ordinary citizens. We encounter art works or artistic activities on the streets and in non-artistic spaces. What are the social and cutlural forces that put art in these new contexts? What does the new pheonomenon called ""public art"" signify to the development of contemporary arts and society. What are the limits and possibilities of public arts. We explore these questions through a wide range of theoretical arguments, history, and contemporary practices of public arts."
USER EXPERIENCE PROTOTYPING ,"""Inventing Future Cities in Post-Pandemic Era""

Sketching and prototyping are the basic methods of design for many different 
purposes. For digital media, the methods are evolving to embrace effective 
idea generations, communications, iterations, and team creativity. The 
class will overview the gradual steps of UX prototyping from observations 
to embodiments.

By the recent technological advancements in ubiquitous computing, 
user experiences on digital media have rapidly changed the “life space” 
of individuals that is multifaceted into complex layers of virtuality. The 
multi-layered user experiences will leverage the peaked emerging 
technologies, such as VR, AR, wearable computing, and AI. 
How could it be imagined, envisioned, and embodied in the sense 
of engaging life experience? Design fiction traditions, film languages, 
and storytelling will guide us to the critical paradigm, design 
for the future.

User Experience Prototyping in 2020 Fall semester will focus on ICT 
innovations and social changes. Especially after the pandemic health 
crisis, ICT innovations will and should contribute to enhance the quality 
of life, social integrity, and participatory opportunities of isolated 
citizens due to the public safety issues. The new norm of social 
distancing for the public health has changed community relationships, 
workplace ethics, and ideas of collaboration. The non-face-to-face 
distance communication technologies such as tele-presence supporting 
tools, VR, AR, MR, and CVE games will gain the concrete territory of 
adaptations. Considering the condition, User Experience Prototyping 
course will proceed an in-depth investigation of Post-Pandemic ICT 
environments and social changes by conducting an ethnographic, 
and in-situ living lab approach for design that impacts the future."
VISUAL SYSTEM ,"Visual Systems is one of the most effective design methodologies used in 
communication design. In the past, design was only thought of as a branch of 
art and a result of feelings and intuition. However, in our current 
information age, design is often the outcome of objective and logical ways 
rather than subjective intuition. Of course, the final result of design is 
usually a combination of logic and intuition. This course aims to develop 
student’s design thinking and methods in an objective, logical and economical 
manner. Visual Systems takes `Maximum diversity from minimum inventory` as its 
motto to pursue economical design. The objective of this subject is also to 
develop and apply the most logical and effective design processes."
USER EXPERIENCE RESEARCH METHODS ,"Any product--whether a website, a technological system, or an electronically 
mediated service--benefits from evaluation before, during, and after the 
development cycle. Too often, the people who use a product cannot find what 
they want or accomplish what they need to do. Products are more successful 
when they are developed through a process that identifies how the products 
will be used, elicits input from potential users, and watches how the product 
function in real time with real users. This course provides a hands-on 
introduction to methods used throughout the entire evaluation process-from 
identifying the goals of the product, picturing who will use it, engaging 
users through a variety of formative evaluation techniques, and confirming a 
product`s function through usability testing and summative evaluation. 
Specific methods include personas and scenarios, competitive analysis, 
observation, surveys, interviews, data analysis, heuristic evaluation, 
usability testing, and diary studies. Students will work on group projects 
that apply these techniques to real products in use or development.

*We will have a special topic for the semester product  - social innovation. While products and services can have various purposes, we aim to provide design implications for  products/services for social innovation. The topics may include but are not limited to  the following: 
- Any topic that brings a social change, which includes the creation of new ideas that propose new alternatives and new social practices for social groups
- UN’s Sustainable Development Goals 
- Citizen science 
- Accessible design"

AS LHP: STATE AND ECONOMY IN MODERN KOREA AND JAPAN ,"This is a reading, writing, and discussion-intensive course that examines developments in trade, energy, economics, and the environment in the course of human development from the premodern to the modern era in Asia and Europe. Using a combination of lecture and class discussion, we will examine the facts and arguments surrounding the “Great Divergence” between European and Asian development within the broader context of European, Asian, economic, and environmental history. We will pay special attention to the dominant historiographies and debates surrounding the course of world history between the general divide of Eastern Civilization and Western Civilization."
AS LHP: THE KOREAN WAR ,"The first part of the course looks at contending subjectivities that emerged during the colonial period: anarcho/communist feminists, bourgeois nationalists, fascist imperial subjects, among others. The second half of the course begins with the question, after Japan’s defeat, and with US and Soviet forces occupying a partitioned Korea, what kind of governments came to power north and south of the 38th parallel? Who were targeted for exclusion or elimination? How was the war conducted? We will conclude the course by reflecting on the war’s continuing impact on the two Koreas and the East Asia region."
AS LHP: JAPANESE POPULAR CULTURE FROM THE 18TH CENTURY TO THE PRESENT ,"This course explores popular culture in modern Japanese history from the mid-Tokugawa period to the present with a specific focus on historical transformations and theoretical analyses.  Today, Japanese popular cultural products, particularly in the form of manga and anime, constitute a part of global consumerism, while continuing to provide new sources of exoticism for connoisseurs as well as nationalistic sentiments for many Japanese.  Though technologies of global network over the past two decades largely contributed to the sweeping circulation of these products, the production and spread of Japanese popular culture cannot be isolated from the history and politics of Tokugawa civilization, Japanese Imperialism, and the Cold War.  Further, as part of East Asian culture, Japanese popular cultural products often provide us with opportunities to test and newly interpret Western theories of popular/mass culture.  For example, can we apply the perspective of “decoding” when examining a 1954 film Godzilla?  To what extent was the postwar economic growth gendered?  How can we historicize violence as part of cultural practices of non-elites? As an exploration of both historical narratives and cultural theories, this course is deigned to: 1) examine the constructed and contested nature of imaginations pertaining to the “popular” against the background of global and domestic changes; and 2) acquaint students with problems and theories of popular culture by treating Japan as a case study to be effectively elaborated in presentations, discussions, and academic essays."
AS LHP: CHINESE CINEMAS; NATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ,"This course examines classic Chinese films from the Republican to contemporary periods as well as exemplary film theories in the field of Chinese film studies. As an artistic innovation, an intellectual current, and a political platform, Chinese cinema has always functioned as a site where nationalist, anti-imperial, and global identities and feelings are formed, negotiated, and remade. Key issues that we will engage throughout the course include some of the followings: spectatorship, cinematic language, modernism, left-wing criticism, ideology, national mythology, urbanism, women and the gaze, gender, class struggle, and linguistic politics and diversity. Students will be able to gain some familiarity with films that belong to the classics of Chinese cinema; at the same time, we will learn new methods of analyzing and critiquing the linkage between “cinema” and “the nation” in the continual process of China’s visual self-making."
AS LHP: MODERNITY AND CHINESE LITERATURE ,"This course investigates exemplary modern Chinese literature of the Republican era (1912-1949) focusing on short stories, novels, and critical texts. We will examine the ways that Chinese writers grappled with the task of modernization in literary and critical writing amidst various challenges and threats from Western and Japanese empires. Course participants will learn the ways in which crucial historical junctures--for instance, the 1919 May Fourth Movement, the 1927 split of United Front between Chinese Communist and Nationalist Parties, and the Second Sino-Japanese War--shaped and reshaped literary practices of modern China. The course focuses on distinctive themes and forms of modern Chinese literature, including revolution, love, national salvation, New Woman, subjectivity, first-person narrative, and appropriation of an omniscient point of view. Throughout the semester, the instructor will guide students to critically analyze assigned texts and discern unique qualities of literary narratives in comparison to other discourses of Republican-era China."
MEMORY POLITICS IN ASIA ,"This discussion-oriented course examines the changing relationship between history, memory, and the formation of national identities in post-WWII Asia. With the help of theories of memory and history, we will explore the ways in which Japanese, Chinese, South/North Koreans, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese have sought to remember and represent their war, colonialism, and other catastrophic events amidst recent changing domestic politics and international relations. In doing so, we will specifically pay attention to the history, discourse, and space: the history of political contestations in Asia; cultural representations of the past in the forms of film, novel, and manga; and lingering conflicts surrounding the sites of commemoration and contestation. This course aims to help students better understand: 1) how historical memories are mobilized to formulate the national identities of each Asian country, and 2) how geopolitics and economic conditions evoke differing historical memories of the same historical events."
NORTH KOREA SINCE 1990 ,"As introduction to the course, we begin with a critical look at how North Korea becomes legible and visible to us. What seems like propaganda, what seems like the “real” North Korea, and why? As historical backdrop, necessary but not sufficient for understanding North Korea today, we examine North Korea’s origins, its history, and place in the socialist world. Starting with North Korea’s revolutionary transformation prior to the Korean War, we will consider how North Korean social and cultural history can be understood apart from the story of Kim Il Sung and his family. We then examine the more recent past: that is, North Korea in the post-socialist world, the famine that killed so many in the mid-/late 1990s, and contemporary issues related to peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula."
ETHNICITY AND CULTURE IN ASIA ,"This is an anthropology course on East Asian cultures. We will explore various socio-cultural aspects of contemporary East Asian society such as social relations, pop culture, gender issues, identity politics, globalization, and transnationalism through anthropological perspectives. A comparative perspective will be employed to explore the commonalities as well as distinctiveness between different cultures and societies."
RELIGIOUS PRACTICE IN KOREAN HISTORY ,"This semester, our readings and discussion will focus on Protestant Christianity. In contrast to frequently repeated accounts of Protestant Christianity as the bearer of enlightened modernity in Korea, we will take a critical look at how Protestant Christianity has shaped (South) Korea’s society, culture, and politics. Broadly, we will examine two related issues: Protestant Christianity and South Korean Capitalism; and Protestant Christianity and Rightwing Politics. 

Our consideration of the Spirit of Capitalism begins with an ethnography of choral singing (songak) and the importance placed on having a “clean” voice. How was it that, for many Protestants, singing in a European-style classical voice came to embody modernity, normative aspirations, as well as Christian faith? In what sense does the “clean” voice embody a Eurocentric culture of accomplishment and aspiration? 

Our examination of Protestant Christianity’s conflict with Communism, North Korea, and progressive politics begins with the novel The Guest, by Hwang Sok-yong, and the massacre that took place in Sinch’on (South Hwanghae Province) during the Korean War. What were the origins of this conflict between Protestant Christians and communists, and how is this conflict waged today?"

Understanding politics, economy, society, and their complex relations of our neighbor, People’s Republic of China becomes indispensable for everyone ? no matter what you study and pursue ? in this globalized era. In this vein, surveying politics of China would be a priority. We will try to systematically (not randomly) analyze and understand those objects through applying some theoretical frameworks of political science such as regime type, political institution, participation, contentious politics, clientelism, developmentalism, nationalism, and interactions between domestic and international politics, to them. More specifically, this course aims at (1) understanding basic political history of contemporary China; (2) theoretically and empirically exposing students to major issues and debates in the study of reform-era Chinese politics and helping students understand major characteristics of the Chinese Communist Party regime; (3) In addition to the conventional contents of “Chinese Politics” course, letting students do a “problem-solving” project from creative and multi-disciplinary perspectives of political interactions as well as politics of things; (4) and finally, encouraging students to pursue their own agendas related to contemporary China in further studies in schools and job market (and beyond)."
