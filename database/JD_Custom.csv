Consequently, we will be prioritizing candidates who can start in this location by set date as expected. We're keeping the situation under review and would adjust our position should the restrictive measures be removed later on.

Minimum qualifications:
 Bachelor's degree or equivalent practical experience. Ability to speak and write in English and Korean fluently. 

Preferred qualifications:
 8 years of experience in consumer/business product marketing and digital marketing, with exposure to holistic marketing campaign planning and execution process. Experience and passion in the technology and digital marketing with understanding of offline/online advertising market, online products, advertisement clients/agency dynamics.  Ability to develop marketing strategies in a client-facing environment. Expertise supporting and enabling a sales organization.  Demonstrated leadership, team orientation and willingness to collaborate internally and externally.  Excellent presentation and communication skills, with creative ability to bring new ideas into product positioning and marketing campaigns. 

About The Job

Whether you're on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product's journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you'll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.

The Large Customer Marketing team is at the forefront of the shift from traditional marketing tactics to new online, mobile, and social strategies. Our team shapes Google's point of view on the advertising landscape and supports growth through effective and results-focused marketing campaigns. As a Product Marketing Manager within the Large Customer Marketing team, you'll drive the marketing strategy, planning, and execution of programs for Google’s advertising business across Korea.

This will involve finding innovative ways to engage decision-makers, educating users regarding our products, promoting Google's business brand, and equipping our Sales teams with the information and tools they need to work more effectively. You'll assist the Sales organization with marketing programs that establish fresh thinking in the industry and deepen engagement with customers. This is a cross-functional role, involving working closely with PR and Sales teams, as well as collaboration with other Marketing teams across Google’s global offices.

Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.

Responsibilities Develop and execute the marketing strategy and plans for advertisers and ad agencies, working closely with the Sales leadership. Identify and execute innovative marketing campaigns, and initiatives to drive education, engagement and product adoption, leveraging various channels such as events, publications, digital/social campaigns, etc. Develop thought-leadership materials, high-level customer and executive narratives/presentations, case studies, and other content designed to accelerate business growth and can be used to more effectively engage with Google's customers and agency partners. Advocate Google's message, best practices and perspectives to our customers and our industry peers via events and other direct customer communication channels. Collaborate with cross-functional teams and individuals to successfully implement marketing strategies and campaigns supporting the advertising business.

                Senior Officer, Article 6 Program Management","Senior Officer, Article 6 Program Management

With the expansion of the Carbon Pricing Unit we are currently seeking a Senior Officer to be the Program Manager primarily for the design phase of the DAPA Program. This will require leading the in- country implementation of the programs across at least 2 countries, likely more.

Generally, requirements of the position will be to plan, organize and implement the program management arrangements through framework setting, and input into the timely and quality day-to-day coordination, technical inputs, monitoring and reporting related to the implementation of the project. He/she will work closely with the Senior Project Associate and other Senior Officers to ensure efficient and effective program delivery. The position will also involve the development of further Article 6 work as a service offering for GGGI, working on generating new activities and workplans that can be crafted into further concepts and proposals for funding.



Introduction

 

During 2019 GGGI has signed 2 earmarked funding programs related to scaling up international carbon trading, as envisaged by the rules to be finalized under the Paris Agreement. By opening up these markets and the resultant flow of transactions it is envisaged a robust and reliable global price for carbon can be establish, something many areas of the private sector have long called for as a way to motivate the transformational change needed to achieve the ambitious goals of Paris.

The programs, Designing Article 6 Policy Approaches (DAPA) and Mobilising Article 6 Transaction Structures (MATS), collectively provide strong earmarked funding for the Carbon Pricing Unit of GGGI well into 2022. The outcomes are common across both programs, to result in real transactions that can be negotiated government to government. The activities under each however differ in type and approach. Under the Norway funded DAPA program the aim is to develop policy approaches, valuing the amount of mitigation outcomes that can be attributed to the introduction of a single, or package of policy measures; then wrapping these into a transaction which will see a flow of carbon finance be exchanged for a share of the resultant mitigation outcomes. The project covers two phases, scoping and design. The scoping phase of the program was successfully completed in mid-2020 - and work will now begin on the Design Phase several countries. For the MATS program funded by Sweden, scoping of projects across the GGGI member and partner countries has also been completed and in country implementation is commencing on 4 projects across 3 countries.

The role of the Article 6 Program Manager is to manage these programs, structuring the frameworks and approaches needed, adapting them to changing circumstances in order to address hurdles and/or opportunities found along the way.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

About The Job

Whether you're on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product's journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base.

                Senior Officer, Article 6 Program Management","Senior Officer, Article 6 Program Management

With the expansion of the Carbon Pricing Unit we are currently seeking a Senior Officer to be the Program Manager primarily for the design phase of the DAPA Program. This will require leading the in- country implementation of the programs across at least 2 countries, likely more.

Introduction

 

During 2019 GGGI has signed 2 earmarked funding programs related to scaling up international carbon trading, as envisaged by the rules to be finalized under the Paris Agreement. By opening up these markets and the resultant flow of transactions it is envisaged a robust and reliable global price for carbon can be establish, something many areas of the private sector have long called for as a way to motivate the transformational change needed to achieve the ambitious goals of Paris.

The programs, Designing Article 6 Policy Approaches (DAPA) and Mobilising Article 6 Transaction Structures (MATS), collectively provide strong earmarked funding for the Carbon Pricing Unit of GGGI well into 2022. The outcomes are common across both programs, to result in real transactions that can be negotiated government to government. The activities under each however differ in type and approach. Under the Norway funded DAPA program the aim is to develop policy approaches, valuing the amount of mitigation outcomes that can be attributed to the introduction of a single, or package of policy measures; then wrapping these into a transaction which will see a flow of carbon finance be exchanged for a share of the resultant mitigation outcomes. The project covers two phases, scoping and design. The scoping phase of the program was successfully completed in mid-2020 - and work will now begin on the Design Phase several countries. For the MATS program funded by Sweden, scoping of projects across the GGGI member and partner countries has also been completed and in country implementation is commencing on 4 projects across 3 countries.

                Principal (Remote) - $400,000/year USD","Have you realized that the future of work is remote and that everything has to change if you’re going to build a remote company? Do you have the top-tier MBA providing the foundation to make organizational decisions with? Did a few years of management consulting experience give you the experience of counseling senior executives on how to improve operations and strategy?

We are looking for the brightest leaders that love learning how businesses work and are full of insights on how to make things simpler. You will need to unlearn what you know about traditional ways to execute so you can define the remote-first organizations that produce work fully asynchronously and to the highest quality standards.

Crossover cracked the code on remote work 15 years ago. We’ve learned the key to success is composing teams of the smartest and most talented individuals in the world. Our all-remote teams are successful because their work is highly-structured and is always measured by simple quality standards.

Our novel approach to building teams does not center around people with old school recruiting and HR backgrounds. Unlike most companies that rely on CVs and interview performance to dominate their hiring decisions, Crossover uses skills assessments built from real work as the largest factor in deciding if a candidate is qualified for a team.

In this unique role, you will be responsible for digging into each team, developing a deep understanding of the work they produce and building the recruiting pipeline that will power that team with the most qualified resources on Earth. The position is a great fit for people with experience as strategy, management or organizational development consultants that have been trained to decompose business processes and reconstruct them in more efficient forms.

코드스테이츠는 자기주도적인 학습을 매우 중요시합니다. 일할 때도 마찬가지로 누가 일을 주기를 가만히 기다리기 보다는 스스로 중요한 문제를 설정하고 그에 대한 해결책을 찾아갑니다. 또한 월간, 주간 계획을 스스로 세우고 본인의 업무를 진행합니다. 매 분기 Self Review 양식을 통해 자신의 성과를 스스로 평가합니다. 본인의 할 일 관리는 Asana(todo list)를 사용합니다.

 각자의 영역에서 본인이 권한과 책임을 갖고 스스로 결정합니다. 

R&R(Role and Responsibility, 역할과 책임)을 먼저 명확히 정합니다. 동료들에게 다양한 피드백을 요청할 수 있지만 R&R 에 따른 책임자가 최종 결정하며, 그에 따른 책임을 집니다. 이러한 의사결정 구조를 가지면 대표나 팀 리더의 별도 승인 없이 빠르게 실행하여, 실수나 부족한 점이 있다면 배우고 다음 번에 더 나은 결정과 실행을 할 수 있게 됩니다.

 Team-Driven 

 우리는 개인보다 함께 일 하는 전체 팀을 먼저 생각합니다. 

우리는 개인의 이익만을 우선하지 않고, 전체 팀의 이익을 생각합니다.

다른 동료의 일을 도와주는 것도 중요한 업무입니다. 업무에 대한 평가에서도 매 분기 진행되는 Peer Review(동료 평가)를 중요한 근거로 활용합니다.

 동료들과 협업을 더 잘 하기 위해 도움이 되는 서비스가 있다면 적극 도입합니다. 

Slack(메신저), Asana(할 일 관리), Notion(회사 정보 및 모든 업무 가이드), Airtable(수강생, 기업 정보), Google Calendar(개인 및 팀 일정), Zoom(원격 회의 및 강의)등이 대표적으로 자주 이용하는 서비스 입니다.

 Move Fast, review, and improve 

 우리는 완벽하지 않더라도 빠른 실행을 통해 우리의 가설을 반복적으로 실험합니다. 

새로운 일을 시작할 때 최소한의 시간과 노력으로 실험하고 결과를 볼 수 있는 방법을 선호합니다.

빠르게 실행하고 결과를 분석하고 더 나은 방향으로 개선하는 작업을 반복합니다. 스스로 좋다고 생각하는 아이디어는, 자신의 영역에서 빠르게 실험하고 결과를 공유하는 방향으로 모두가 자신의 의견을 자유롭게 검증해 볼 수 있습니다. 결과가 좋지 않다면 다음 실험에서 더 좋은 결과를 낼 수 있도록 배울 점을 찾고, 결과가 좋다면 공유하고 서로 칭찬합니다.

 Continuous Learning 

 우리는 끊임없이 배우고 성장하기 위한 자기계발에 적극 투자합니다. 

온라인 과정(Udemy, Udacity), 세미나, 컨퍼런스 등 함께 일 하는 멤버들의 성장을 위한 모든 종류의 교육을 적극 지원합니다.

또한 우리가 사용하는 교육 소프트웨어를 직접 개발하는 과정을 통해 교육과 개발을 지속적으로 병행합니다.

 Transparency 

 우리는 서로 솔직하게 의사표현 합니다. 

실수한 일을 숨기기보다는 공유하고 문제를 함께 해결할 수 있도록 노력합니다. 회고 시간을 갖고 팀으로서 잘했던 일을 칭찬하고, 아쉬웠거나 개선되어야 할 점을 솔직하고 자유롭게 논의합니다.

누구나 회의의 진행자가 되어 회의를 이끌고 의견을 표현할 수 있습니다.

경영진과의 일대일 면담을 통해 솔직한 이야기가 오갈 수 있도록 장려합니다.

 우리는 회사의 정보를 가능한 투명하게 모두 공유합니다. 

회사에 관한 거의 모든 정보는 Notion 을 통해 기록되고 공유됩니다.

 Outcomes-Driven 

 우리는 언제 어떻게 일하든 실제 달성한 업무 성과를 가장 중요시 합니다. 

명확한 근무시간, 장소를 규정하기 보다 가장 효율적인 방식을 스스로 선택합니다.

또한 오전 8시 ~ 11시 사이에 자유롭게 출근합니다.(오늘 아침 일어났는데, 잠이 부족하면 1시간 넉넉히 더 자고 일어나도 됩니다.) 패스트파이브 삼성 3호점에서 주로 근무하지만, 원격 근무 도입을 늘려가고 있습니다.

우리가 목표로 하는 성과를 달성할 수 있다면, 시간과 장소는 크게 구애받지 않고 일할 수 있는 환경입니다.

 Automation 

 우리는 자동화할 수 있는 업무에 대해 끊임없이 고민합니다. 

우리는 업무 자동화에 대해 계속 실험하고, 불필요한 리소스를 줄일 수 있는 방법을 함께 고민합니다. 그리고 실험하고 고민한 결과를 모든 크루와 공유하는 시간을 갖습니다.

 도서 지원 
우리는 글을 읽고, 쓰는 사람들을 좋아합니다. 업무와 연관된 책 구매를 지원합니다. 단, 한 책을 읽고 배우거나 느낀 점을 팀과 간단하게라도 공유한 이후에, 다음 책을 구매할 수 있습니다.  교육비 지원

우리는 개인의 성장이 곧 팀의 성장이라고 믿습니다. 따라서 팀원 개인이 성장할 수 있도록 업무와 관련된 워크샵, 세미나, 컨퍼런스 등을 적극적으로 지원하고 있습니다. 다녀온 뒤에는 후기를 함께 공유하여 모든 팀원에게 도움이 될 수 있도록 합니다.  장비 지원 
업무에 필요한 기본 장비(맥북, 모니터 등)는 입사시 제공합니다. 아이패드 등 기타 추가로 필요한 장비도 업무에 필요하다면 언제든 요청할 수 있습니다.  코드스테이츠 프로그램 무료 참여 
코드스테이츠의 교육 프로그램에 모두 무료로 참여 가능합니다. 현재 오픈되어 있는 Software Engineering 과정 뿐만 아니라 추후 오픈 예정인 Growth, Product Management, Data 과정도 모두 무료로 수강할 수 있습니다.  쾌적한 사무실 
하루의 대부분을 보내는 사무실 공간은 매우 중요한 부분이라고 생각합니다. 코드스테이츠는 패스트파이브 삼성 3호점을 사용하고 있습니다. 프라이빗 오피스 뿐만 아니라 라운지 등을 활용해서 쾌적하고 청결한 공간에서 일할 수 있습니다. 이 모든 공간은 패스트파이브 직원분들이 매일 청소해 주십니다. 또한 공유 오피스에서 우유, 커피, 차, 맥주도 기본적으로 제공합니다.  점심식사 제공 
사무실 출근 시 점심은 주변 식당이나 샐러드를 주문해서 함께 먹습니다. 1만원 이내에서 자유롭게 메뉴를 선택합니다. 야근을 지향하는 문화는 아니지만, 필요한 경우 야근을 할 때가 있습니다. 그런 때에도 물론 저녁식사가 제공됩니다.  크루간 1 on 1 랜덤 커피타임 
코드스테이츠 모든 크루를 랜덤으로 선정하여 업무시간 중 월별 선정된 크루끼리 커피타임을 통해 서로 소통하고 스몰톡을 나누며 자유롭게 서로를 이해합니다.  타운홀 미팅 
회사 전반 소식을 타운홀미팅을 통해 보다 투명하게 공개하고 코드스테이츠 운영 전반을 모든 크루들이 함께 소통하고 토론을 통해 참여합니다.  오전 8시 ~ 11시 자율 출근 
사람마다 가장 효율적으로 일할 수 있는 시간대가 다르다고 생각합니다. 따라서 오전 8시 ~ 11시 사이에 본인이 원하는 시간대를 스스로 선택해서 출근할 수 있습니다.  유연한 원격근무 
주 1회 리모트 근무를 통해 원하는 곳 어디서나 일할 수 있습니다.  성과에 따른 합당한 보상 제공 
단순 급여 뿐만 아니라 스톡옵션 패키지 제안을 통해 회사의 성장과 함께 크루들이 더 큰 보상을 가져갈 수 있도록 합니다. 탁월한 성과를 내는 분에게는 연간 단위의 보상 논의보다 빠르게 보상을 제안합니다.  성장하는 회사에서 함께하는 뛰어난 크루들과의 협업 기회 
3년 안에 62%의 스타트업이 문을 닫는다고 합니다. 하지만 코드스테이츠는 2016년 이후 매년 성장을 거듭하고 있습니다. 2018년 첫 투자, 2019년 추가 투자를 유치하고, 빠르게 회사가 성장하고 있습니다. 또한 한국, 미국, 유럽 등에서 경험을 쌓은, 다양한 배경을 가진 뛰어난 크루들이 실제 성과를 만들고 있습니다. 현재는 대부분 한국에 파트너 회사가 있지만 앞으로는 싱가폴, 일본, 동남아, 유럽, 미국 등 다양한 지역에 엔지니어를 필요로 하는 파트너 회사들을 발굴할것입니다. 이에 따라 글로벌한 회사들과 협력하는 일들이 늘어날 예정입니다.

This person will have their finger on the pulse of city life and will find ways to integrate Beam deeply into the city. The Community Manager will localize the brand and develop strong local partnerships (with support from country level and company-wide teams) that make Beam relevant to each city's specific issues, events and opportunities.

Drive numbers of subscribers to Beam social feeds, and spot opportunities to create strong local messaging. Work with regional creative and design team to create locally-relevant assets. Take the lead in organizing all events and marketing activation targeted at riders, including press and safety training events. Support local media relations and guerrilla marketing activities, together with country and company-wide teams In collaboration with members from the regional team, create a wide array of brand assets that are localized to the city of operation. Manage multiple stakeholders in a cross functional and collaborative environment. 
 
Requirements:

 Minimum 5+ years of experience marketing and partnership development such as events management, business development or community relations. Good understanding of relevant social media and experience of managing communities through social platforms. Demonstrated ability to forge local partnerships from prospecting through close. Ability to manage budgets. A collaborative style. Prior experience in community management is highly advantageous.
